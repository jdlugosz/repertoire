<H1>Makeframe.html didn't work?</H1>
<P>This pane is <I>supposed</I> to show the main document that was chosen.  If you
can see this instead, and the file isn't still loading, that didn't happen.</P>

<H2>Usage of mainframe.html</H2>
<P>If you entered the url for makeframe.html directly, this is what you'll get.  You
probably meant to use <A href="mainframe.html">mainframe.html</A> instead.</P>
<P>To use makeframe.html, give two arguments like so:</P>
<PRE>
  &hellip;/makeframe.html?infodoc+indexdoc
</PRE>
<P>Where <code>infodoc</code> is the URL of the document you want to appear
in this space, and <code>indexdoc</code> is the URL to put in the left pane.</P>

<H2>Got this instead of the desired document</H2>
<P>If you used a url of a document in this set, e.g. message_tap.html, then that document
will invoke makeframe.html to put itself together with the proper index page.  Somehow, that
process started but did not complete.</P>

<P>I've seen this happen in Microsoft's IE6 when the file is served locally.  If the
url is a file, rather than a web host, then it ignores the stuff after the '?' on the
address line!  It's rather flakey in what it takes for a filename, too.
</P>

<P>To suppress this behavior and look at the document alone, append "?NOFRAMES"
to the URL.  For example, message_tap.html becomes "message_tap.html?NOFRAMES".
Or, disable javascript for this set of pages.</P>
