<A NAME="1"><H2>Concept</H2></A>
A ustring object acts as a flexible cubbyhole.  You can easily stick some kind of string in,
and later, get some kind of string out.  If the type asked for is different from what's in there,
it is automatically converted.</P>

<A NAME="2"><H3>Wide or Narrow</H3></A>
The ustring's primary role is to be either wide or narrow.  This cuts down the number of
functions needed when both 8-bit character and Unicode support is desired.</P>

<P>When a function takes a paramter of type <code>ustring</code>, the caller may pass either 
a <code>string</code> or a <code>wstring</code>.  Either is accepted without complaint.
Meanwhile, the function may decide to do different things based on whether the incoming 
string is wide or narrow; or, it could just get a wide string and have any narrow string 
converted.</P>

<h4>example &mdash; before ustring</h4>
<pre>
void foo (string);  //narrow form of function
void foo (wstring);  //wide form of function
</pre>
<h4>with ustring</h4>
<pre>
void foo (ustring);  //only one form
</pre>

Within the function, you can have separate code for each case, or have the input
automatically converted.
Use the <code>is_wide</code> function to detect whether a wide or narrow string is present.</P>

<pre>
void foo (ustring x)
 {
 if (x.is_wide()) {
    wstring s= x;  //get the string out
    //...
    }
 else {  //must be narrow
    string s= x;  //get the string out
    //... simpler processing for 8-bit characters
    }
 }
</pre>
<B>-- or -- </B>
<pre>
void foo (ustring x)
 {
 wstring s= x;  //get wide out, convert if needed.
 //... wide case subsumes narrow; works for all.
 }
</pre>

<H3>Wide/Narrow Conversions</H3>
Using this class as a go-between is the preferred way to "blindly" &mdash; that is, without special processing instructions &mdash;
convert between 8-bit and 16-bit character sets.  It uses the Win32 functions MultiByteToWideChar and WideCharToMultiByte
to do its work, so it should handle the situation, including multi-byte characters, on any nationalized version of Win32.</P>

<A NAME="3"><H3>Multiple String Class Conversions</H3></A>

<P>In addition, this class may be used to transparantly convert between different brands of string class, making it
the Babel-fish of string representations.  This will let you use your string class of choice and still
easily use the Classics library.  In addition, if you have different string classes in different libraries in your program,
this feature can transparently communicate between them for you.</P>

<P>For example, you could put an MFC <code>CString</code> in, and get a <code>classics::wstring</code> out,
so you could trivially pass CString's to foo in the above example.  Likewise on return values &mdash; you could
get a Rogue Wave string out, for example, regardless of what the function actually returned to you.</P>

<P>In order to provide transparent conversion, letting you put your type into a ustring and get your type out,
you need to <A HREF="#create_header">create a header</A> and include it in the files that need this capability.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, other code that was compiled with no knowledge of your type will accept such ustrings
and want to get their own types out.  This is handled with an <A HREF="#awareness">interface module</A> you provide,
which explains how to read and write data from and to your type, and will be used polymorphically by any <code>ustring</code>
instance that finds itself holding one of your strings.</P>

<A NAME="5"><H2>Using the ustring class</H2></A>

<P>The <code>ustring</code> class is designed to facilitate the exchange of parameters only.  It desn't "do" anything
that you expect of a string object.  The desired functionality belongs to a real string class, and the problem is that
there are many such string classes, each of which do different things.  The <code>ustring</code> object allows
you to pass or return any kind of string object you choose, but is not itself a usable string.</P>

<A NAME="6"><H3>Passing Parameters</H3></A>

<P>The recommended way to write a function to take string arguments is:
<PRE>
void foo (const ustring& us)
 {
 preferred_string_type s= us;  //extract the information
 process (s);  //use s throughout, never touching us again.
 }
</PRE>

<UL>
	<LI>Declare the parameter of type ustring</P>
		<P>The preferred method is to use a <code>const ustring&</code>.  This will cause a ustring to be
			created if you call foo with a concrete string type, but will not duplicate the ustring (and the underlying
			concrete string) if you pass an existing ustring instead.</P>
	<LI>Extract a concrete string</P>
		<P>Declare a string variable locally and initialize it with the parameter.  The ustring will spit out the
			correct type.  If you extract the same type that was passed, no extra work is done, as the ustring
			just unwraps the original value.  If you extract a different type, an object of that type is created.</P>
</UL>

<A NAME="7"><H3>Returning Values</H3></A>

<P>To return a string value, declare the function to return a ustring.

<PRE>
ustring bar (int index)
 {
 CString s;
 // ... do stuff with s involving dialog boxes or whatever ...
 return s;
 }
</PRE>

Within the function, use whatever concrete string type you choose.  Sometimes a particular string class is especially
convienient for a particular function, as with this example that wants to use a <code>CString</code> because it makes other
MFC calls.</P>

<P>In any case, write the function normally, as if your desired string class were the only one in the world.  Then, when
you return the string (of whatever actual string type you worked with), it will be wrapped in the ustring for
exporting back to the caller.  The caller can write <code> std::wstring result=bar(5);</code> without caring that
the function uses Microsoft's MFC strings.</P>

<P>Originally, the <code>ustring</code> class did not allow instances to be copied.  This meant that the simple
case of 
<PRE>
ustring bardone()  { return bar(-1); }
</PRE>
could not be written, because the return value from bar needs to be copied again.  Now, such code is legal because
<code>ustring</code> has a copy constructor that clones the wrapped string.  This is not too terribly ineficient, as it
only adds a layer of indirection around the copy constructor for the underlying concrete string (which ought to be using
some kind of reference counting).  But it is even more efficient if you have no need to cascade ustring calls like this.</P>

<P>That is, only use <code>ustring</code>s to form your public interface, and don't pass them around within your
own implementation.  Within your implementation, use your chosen string type throughout.

<PRE>
CString bar_internal (int);
inline ustring bar (int x)  { return bar_internal(x); }
inline ustring bardone()  { return bar_internal(-1); }
</PRE>

Although generally a good idea to use your preferred string class consistantly throughout your implementation (rendering
cascading <code>ustring</code> calls unnecessary), this is not always the natural solution.  For example, you may 
be using <code>std::string</code> throughout, but some functions want to use <code>CString</code> instead, for 
interfacing with MFC classes.  Second, for non-trivial operations the extra overhead is not an issue.</P>

<P>So, you <I>can</I> copy a ustring value if you need to, but if used as designed there is rarely the need.</P>

<A NAME="conversion"><H3>Converting Strings Explicitly &mdash; string_cast</H2></A>

<P>So far in this section, we have seen strings converted as a way of marshalling the data between functions
that may have been written using different string classes.</P>

<P>As we saw in the introduction, the <code>ustring</code> class does more than this.  It can also convert
between 8-bit and 16-bit character representations, or between ANSI and OEM 8-bit character sets.  Sometimes
you want to trigger this behavior explicitly.</P>

<P>Obviously, you can do it like this:
<pre>
	ustring temp= s;
	wstring result= temp;
</pre>

or even

<pre>
	wstring result= ustring(s);
</pre>

but a cleaner method is to use the <code>string_cast</code>.

<pre>
	wstring result= string_cast&lt;wstring&gt; (s);
</pre>

The <code>string_cast&lt;T&gt;(s)</code> template will convert the argument <code>s</code> (which must be
of a "string type") to <code>T</code>, using the same mechanism that <code>ustring</code> uses to convert between types.
This avoids the need to create an intermediate ustring wrapper around <code>s</code> first.

<A NAME="CString_support"><H2>MFC's CString Support</H2>

<P>Among other things, the <code>ustring</code> component converts to and from the MFC <code>CString</code>
class, as found in AFX.H and used extensivly with the Microsoft Foundation Classes.</P>

<A NAME="CString_notes"><H3>Notes on Microsoft's Class</H3></A>

<P>There is a race condition associated with the "lock" concept.  Given two <code>CString</code>s <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code>,
one thread can call <code>s1=s2;</code> while another thread calls <code>s2.LockBuffer();</code>.  The implementation
does not guarantee that <code>s2</code> will be locked before it's bound into <code>s1</code> (so the assignment sees
<code>s2</code> as locked), or that <code>s2</code> will be locked after it's bound into <code>s1</code> (so
 <code>LockBuffer</code> sees that the reference count is greater than 1).  Instead, you
could wind up with an illegal state where <code>s2</code> is locked but still sharing a reference with <code>s1</code>.
This will turn into a
stray pointer bug when either <code>s1</code> or <code>s2</code> replaces its reference or is destructed.</P>

<P>There are race conditions in general when writing to a <code>CString</code>.
Because the implementation refers to the referenced data well <I>after</I> releasing its ownership (by decrementing
the reference count), it's possible that all other references could be released, in other threads, in the mean time.  Then
the first thread will have a stray pointer.  For example, <code>s1=s2;</code> so they share the same reference-counted
character data; then one thread executes <code>s1.SetAt(index,ch);</code> while another thread executes
<code>s2=s3;</code>, arguably a totally unrelated operation.  But it's possible for the <code>SetAt</code> call to lose the contents
of <code>s1</code> before it finishes making its unique copy for the &ldquo;copy on write&rdquo; operation.  This bug is
general throughout the code.</P>

<P>Although <code>InterlockedIncrement</code> and <code>InterlockedDecrement</code> is used for the
reference count itself, it is by no means safe to manipulate the same reference-counted object in two threads at
the same time.  Since different <code>CString</code> objects may refer to the same underlying data, it is generally 
unsafe to use the <code>CString</code> class from more than one thread.  Microsoft's use of atomic counters for the 
reference count gives a false impression that the class is thread-safe</P>

<P><code>CString</code>s don't work with standard output.  For some reason, there is no <code>operator&lt;&lt;</code>
defined for it.   If you write:
<pre>
CString message= _T("hello world!");
std::cout &lt;&lt; message;
</pre>
You will get no compiler error, but a very strange result.  It displays a large numeric value (an address?) in hex
rather than the contents of the string!</P>

<P>In order to display the <code>CString</code>, you can write:
<pre>
std::cout &lt;&lt;  LPCTSTR(message);
</pre>
instead, which uses the operator <code>TCHAR</code> conversion to display the underlying <code>char*</code> data.
However, the use of the "T" generic types is misleading here, because it doesn't work if compiled under Unicode.  The line above
prints an address, not the string, if <code>TCHAR</code> is a <code>wchar_t</code>.  This is not because the standard
library correctly does not have an output operator for a nul-terminated <code>wchar_t</code> on a narrow stream, but 
rather because it <I>does</I> have a non-standard output operator for this case which doesn't work.  Presumably it
has something to do with the fact that <code>wchar_t</code> isn't a distinct type like it's supposed to be.</P>

<P>In the testing program <code>ustring_test_CString.cxx</code> this is worked-around by defining
a proper output operator for <code>CString</code> as part of the program.</P>

<A NAME="use_CString"><H3>Using CString with ustring</H3></A>

<P>In order to use <code>CString</code> with the ustring conversion system, simply include <code>AFX.H</code> (or something
else that pulls it in), which contains the class definition for <code>class ::CString</code>, before 
including <code>classics\ustring.h</code>
(or anything else that pulls it in).</P>

<P>Note that <code>CString</code> deals either with wide or narrow characters depending on conditinoal compilation
within the <code>AFX.H</code> header file.  You can't have both wide and narrow <code>CString</code>s in the same program
as you can with other string classes.  The <code>ustring.h</code> header file notes the current option and treats <code>CString</code>
as wide or narrow, as indicated.</P>

<P>For examples, see the unit test program <code>classics\ustring_CString_test.cxx</code>.</P>

<H3>How it Works</H3>
 
<P>The <code>classics.dll</code> is not dependant on the MFC dlls.  That would have been undesirable, not only because such
a dependancy is unwelcome in the general case, but the conditional compilation nature of <code>CString</code> means
that there are <I>different</I> dll's depending on whether you compile MFC for wide or narrow strings, and
you can't link to both of them.  Not only would Classics also have to come in two flavors as well, but then it would
reference a specific version of MFC rather than being compatible with any version.</P>

<P>So, Classics contains a small file that essentially clones Microsoft's <code>CString</code> class.  It knows the structure
layout and the manner in which the reference counting works and the manner in which data is maintained within
the string.  The <code>ustring::awareness</code> object (which is the only code that knows about specific string types) for
<code>CString</code> then uses this code instead of code found in <code>MFCS42u.dll</code> (or whereever).</P>

<P>As far as the <code>ustring.h</code> class is concerned, it uses the <code>MFC_CString&lt;T&gt;</code> parameterized type (unlike 
Microsoft's, it allows wide and narrow objects to co-exist) and doesn't care that such has objects that are identical
with <code>::CString</code>'s on a binary level.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, if <code>AFX.H</code> has been included (therefore, <code>CString</code> is defined), a couple of inline functions are
conditionally compiled-in to ustring.h.  These (one for setting, one for getting) simply cast the <code>CString</code> object
into the internal type, or vice versa, and generate no actual code.</P>

<P>The result is transparent <code>CString</code> support on demand, with all support code located inside the <code>classics.dll</code>
rather than expanded into the calling program (via inline functions or templates).</P>



<A NAME="4"><H2>Adding Support for Additional String Classes</H2></A>

<P>The <code>ustring</code> class is extensible, in that you can add support for additional string types.
To do this, you supply an overloaded <code>get_string_awareness</code> function defined for your
type.</P>

<A NAME="awareness"><H3>Creating the Awareness Object</H3></A>

<P>In order to inform the <code>ustring</code> component about your type (say, <code>SillyString</code>),
you declare an overloaded form of the <code>get_string_awareness</code> function.  This
overloaded form will be found when the <code>get_as</code> or <code>set_as</code> template is invoked, so the library
will receive the correct <code>awareness</code> object.</P>

<pre>
const ustring::awareness_t* get_string_awareness (const SillyString*);
</pre>

<P>So just what is an <code>awareness</code> object?  That's an adaptor or interface of sorts that
tells the ustring how to manipulate the thing its wrapping.  You must derive from the abstract base class
<code>ustring::awareness_t</code>, and provide definitions for several pure virtual functions that
describe how to manipulate the string.</P>

<P>Implementing the concrete awareness class is simple.  In general, you cast the <code>void*st</code> argument (the 
"black box" being held by the ustring wrapper) into the actual string class, in this example a <code>SillyString*</code> and
then do the corresponding operation on that object.  For example,</P>

<PRE>
class SillyString_awareness : public ustring::awareness_t {
   int length (const void* st) const
    {
    const SillyString* s= static_cast&lt;const SillyString*&gt;(st);
    	//first cast st to my actual type
    return s->elcount();
    	//then perform the operation.
    }
</PRE>
