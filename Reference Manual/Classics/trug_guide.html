<H2 id="overview">Overview</H2>

<P>A <I>trug</I> is a general container.  It holds something else.  The term <I>trug</I> can be used to refer to any
concrete implementation of the proper interface (see <A HREF="#hypothetical" class="code">hypothetical_trug</A>),
and the actual template named trug has a few supplied specializations.</P>

<P>A trug of a pointer type, e.g. <code>trug&lt;int&></code>, provides strict ownership semantics
and automatic destruction for pointers, similarly to the standard <code>std::auto_ptr</code> class.</P>

<P>A trug of a Windows <code>HANDLE</code> type provides strict ownership and automatic destruction in an analogous way 
to the pointers.  For example, <code>trug&lt;HKEY></code> knows to call the Win32 API function <code>RegCloseKey</code>
when &ldquo;freed&rdquo;.</P>

<H2 id="housekeeping">Threading and Housekeeping Issues</H2>

<P>The supplied trug classes don’t have any particular thread safety built in.  The various members
should be serialized, but may be called from any thread as long as only one member is called at
a time.</P>

<P>The &ldquo;housekeeping&rdquo; is what this class is all about.  The point of using a trug
is to impose automatic housekeeping management and/or error checking on the contained
object.</P>

<P>A trug may not be copied directly.  So, its copy constructor and copy assignment operator
are disabled.  However, the trug will give the sense of copying (in particular, returning
a trug from a function) by using the matching trule class.</P>

<H2 id="purpose">Purpose and Concept</H2>

<P>A trug is a generalized container.  The purpose of a trug is to hold something else.  The reasons
for putting such a wrapper around something include abstracting an indirect storage mechanism and
imposing houskeeping semantics.</P>

<P>The name <I>trug</I> comes from the English gardening basket (for examples, see <A HREF="http://www.sussextrugs.com/" TARGET="external">
Royal Sussex Trug</A> store).  Lately I've seen it used for any kind of general-purpose container,
such as <A HREF="http://www.leevalley.com/garden/page.asp?SID=&ccurrency=2&page=44667&category=2,2120,33278" TARGET="external">these</A>
that have nothing to do with the traditional shape and construction.  This template’s purpose as a
handy often-used container lives up to its namesake.</P>

<H2 id="what">What Do I Do With It?</H2>

<UL>
	<LI>Pass and return pointers or HANDLEs without losing track of who’s responsibility it is to delete it.
	<LI>Make local variables of these types safe for exceptions.
	<LI>Add destructor semantics to pointers or HANDLEs, for ease in making them members of a class.
	<LI>Have pointers that need to be deleted in an unusual way automatically do so.
	<LI>Generalize a container for use in writing templates, so template code can use indirect or proxy references.
</UL>

<P>Consider the following examples.  The trug is being used to hold a primitive pointer, and you can see
it gives the same benifits as the <code>std::auto_ptr</code>.</P>

<PRE class="code" style="float:left; margin-right:2em">
typedef array_trug&lt;int*> atp;

atp::trule foo (int size)
 {
 atp <B>p1</B> (new int [size]);
 do_stuff_1();
 atp <B>p2</B> (new int [size*2]);
 do_stuff_2();
 return p1;
 }

<I>// later&hellip;</I>
atp p3= foo (x);
</PRE>

<P>You’ll notice that <code>p1</code>, <code>p2</code>, and <code>p3</code> are defined to be of type
<code>atp</code> rather than type <code>int*</code>.   Here is what that does for us.</P>

<P>First of all, notice that <code>p2</code> is never explicitly deleted.  Like with any normal self-respecting
object type, it takes care of itself and knows to delete the pointer when it goes out of scope.</P>

<P>That may be a handy bit of help that avoids a little typing and some effort to pay attention to the
needs, but the benefit is more serious than that.  What happens if the function throws an exception?  If an
exception is thrown during <code>do_stuff_1</code>, then it will automatically delete <code>p1</code>
when unwinding the stack.  If the exception is thrown during <code>do_stuff_1</code>, then it knows
to delete both <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code>.  Meanwhile, if the function runs to completion
it knows to delete <code>p2</code> but leave <code>p1</code> to be transfered to the caller!  Making
this function exception-safe with two ordinary pointers would require a lot of care and quite a few more lines,
wrapping the whole thing in a try block and moving the definitions of the variables away from their point of
first use.  Simply giving them destructors is so much easier!  It makes them work the way stuff
ought to work in C++.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, the caller knows that <code>foo</code> will return a pointer and that the caller
takes responsibility for the pointer returned.  Such responsibilities are often under-documented,
while here the compiler enforces it.  This is explored further in the next example.</P>

<PRE class="code" style="clear:both; float:right; margin-left:2em">
typedef array_trug&lt;int*> atp;

void f1 (atp param1);  // wrong!
void f2 (const atp& param2);
void f3 (int* param4);

<I>// later&hellip;</I>
atp p1 (new int [42]);

f1 (p1);  <I>// compile-time error!</I>
f2 (p1);
f3 (p1);  <I>// compile-time error!</I>
f3 (p1.eject());
f3 (p1.duplicate());
f3 (p1.get_r());  // not a good idea
</PRE>

<P>fffffff fffffff fffffffff ffffffffff
