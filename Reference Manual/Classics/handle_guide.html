<H3>Handling</H3>

<P>A handle (of any flavor) must<A HREF="#footnote_must" class="footnoter" target="footer">1</A> only point to a dynamically-allocated object, since the handle
will call <code>delete</code> on it when the reference count hits zero.  Obviously, using the address of a stack-based
or global variable is a bad idea.</P>

<P>A freshly-constructed object, upon returning from <code>new</code>, should have an original reference count
of zero.  Ideally, the first and only thing you do with that pointer is to give it to a handle.  That increments the reference count,
and now the object is part of the system and should not be freed directly.</P>
<PRE class="code">
handle&lt;C> h (new C);  <I>// normal way to create a handled object</I>
</PRE>

<PRE class="code" style="float:left; margin-right:2em">
class D : public B, public C { <I>// &hellip;</I>

void foo (handle&lt;D>&amp;);

/*virtual*/ void D::bar()
 {
 handle&lt;D> self (this);
 foo (self);
 <I>// &hellip;</I>
 }

void baz (handle&lt;C>&amp; h)
 {
 h->bar();
 }
</PRE>

<P>Ideally, you would use handles only and not complicate things by using raw pointers to the same object as well.
But there is one case where you can’t get away from it:  The <code>this</code> pointer!  It may be necessary for
a member function to recover the handle when it only has the raw pointer.  This feature is called &ldquo;Lost &amp; Found&rdquo;.</P>

<P>The listing on the left shows why you can’t avoid the problem.  Even if &ldquo;everything&rdquo; is written using handles
and you never pass raw pointers around, you still have <code>this</code>.  Here <code>bar</code> is called on a handle,
and the body of <code>bar</code> is not passed the handle&mdash;only the raw pointer.</P>

<P>So it is necessary to construct a handle around the pointer.  But this is not a newly-created object; it is an object that
is already known to smart pointers and has a reference count that is not zero.  In this case, the <code>handle</code>
constructor will deal with it correctly, and the library will understand that <code>self</code> is the same object as <code>h</code>.</P>

<P>To make things even more interesting, notice that the complete <code>D</code> object does not have the same
address as the <code>C</code> base class subobject.  Even though <code>h</code> and <code>self</code> have
different declared types, and contain different addresses, the library understands that they are the <I>same object</I>.</P>

<P>In general, handles of different declared types can be <A HREF="#handle_cast">cast or implicitly converted</A> in exactly the same way as raw pointers
to those types.  It works with multiple inheritance, virtual inheritance, polymorphic objects or simple structures.  Basically, there
is very little you can’t do with handles.</P>


<H3 id="threads">Threading and Thread Safety</H3>

<P>The handle library is specifically designed to use with threads.  The reference counting, both owning count and
non-owning <A HREF="#baro">borrower</A> count, is not only thread-safe but
non-blocking<A HREF="#footnote_blocking" class="footnoter" target="footer">2</A>.  Different threads may
create, destroy, and copy handles to the same object, at the same time, and the library reliably determines the last
owner that goes away.  Handing object lifetimes with multiple threads is the main reason for designing this library.</P>

<P>Suppose thread A uses a handle <code>h1</code>, and thread B uses a handle <code>h2</code>, both pointing to the same
underlying object.  When thread A is done with it, it lets <code>h1</code> go out of scope.  When thread B is done with it, it lets
<code>h2</code> go out of scope.  Assuming there are no other handles to the object besides these two, you can be certain that
the correct thread&mdash;the last one to be finished with it&mdash;will destroy the object.</P>

<P>When it comes to <I>using</I> the object being handled, that is beyond the scope of the handle library.  If thread
A calls <code>h1->foo()</code> and at the same time thread B calls <code>h2->foo()</code>, the handles take care
of their part without any sweat.  But it is the implementation of <code>foo</code> that determines if the same object can be used
simultainiously on two threads.  The handles manage the shared object’s lifetime only, and does not have anything to do
with the thread safety of the object being handled.</P>

<P>Two threads can each have their own separate handle to the same underlying object.  But two threads should not use
the same handle itself.  If thread A and B both referred to a global <code>h3</code>, and thread A called <code>h3->foo()</code> at the
same time that thread B called <code>h3=0</code>, you get undefined behavior.</P>

<P>The only things you do to modify handle objects themselves (as opposed to dereferencing them and modifying the
underlying object) are construct, destruct, and assign.</P>

<P>When one thread is constructing an object, no other thread should know about it let alone be using it.  Likewise,
if one thread is destructing an object then no other thread should be using it.  This is generally true in C++ and is
not a special rule for the handle classes.  Finally, if one thread is assigning to a handle, no other thread should be
using it.  Again, that is normal C++ behavior.  But, it happens to be about the only thing you can do to get the
reference count messed up, short of knowingly dangerous constructs like <code>memcpy</code>.</P>

<P>A <code>cow</code> (copy on write) handle has another subtle feature, though.  A multiple ownership is essentially a lazy
or delayed copy.  When the <code>cow</code> is dereferenced, the actual copy is made.  This means that the innocent-looking
<A HREF="handle.html#operator_arrow" class="code">operator-></A> is a modifying operation, just like assignment!  This is surprising and unintuative, and as of Public Build 8 (July 2006)
the library deals with this transparantly.  Two threads that call <code>cow1->foo()</code> at the same time, on a shared <code>cow1</code> variable,
with a pending lazy copy, will work itself out.</P>

<H1>Footnotes</H1>
<P id="footnote_must" class="footnote">A handle must point to a dynamically-allocated object, since the handle
will call <code>delete</code> on it when the reference count hits zero.</P>
<P>That is the <I>only</I> reason why you shouldn’t make handles to static or local variables.  The shared empty <code>vararray</code>,
essentially a singleton, is indeed static.  It is never deleted because the reference count is artificially increased.  See
<code>make_the_empty</code> in <span class="filename">data_t.h</span>.</P>

<P id="footnote_blocking" class="footnote">Handles are non-blocking.</P>
<P>The <code>cow</code> handle may need to wait if multiple threads trigger
the delayed-copying of the same handle (not the same object, but the same handle variable) at the same time.  See
notes at <A HREF="handle.html#make_unique" class="code" target="info">make_unique</A>.</P>
