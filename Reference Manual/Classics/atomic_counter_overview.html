<H1>atomic_counter</H1>

<P>The <code>atomic_counter</code> template provides for incrementing and decrementing values
in a thread-safe manner.</P>

<P>More on the concepts involved and a detailed description of the implementation can be found
in the August 1998 issue of <A HREF="http://www.pinpub.com/vcd/" TARGET="_blank" ><I>Visual C++ Developer</I></A>.
A similar treatment appears as a <A HREF="atomic_counter_whitepaper.html#toptop">whitepaper</A> on this site.</P>

The template allows you to declare a thread-safe value of any type.
<pre>
atomic_counter&lt;int&gt; x1;
atomic_counter&lt;unsigned long&gt; x2;
atomic_counter&lt;byte&gt; x3 = 5;
<!-- original text:
atomic_counter<int> x1;
atomic_counter<unsigned long> x2;
atomic_counter<byte> x3 = 5;
-->
</pre>

A selection of read/modify/write operations are provided, including
<UL>
	<code>++</code> and <code>--</code> (prefix and postfix)</br>
	<code>+=</code> and <code>-=</code>
</UL>
They allow modification of the value and testing of the value (either new or old, depending on the operator)
in an unbroken operation, so other threads won't change things between the "read" and the "write", and
the result is in sync with this particular operation even if other threads are changing the value too.</P>

<P>A conversion operator allows the atomic_counter to be used as a plain value.</P>

<P>The template is designed with a dual personality.  It may be used with <i>any</i> type, as long as these
underlying operations are supported.  For example, a floating point type or a user-defined BCD class.  In the
general case (which is <B>not implemented</b>), it uses a critical section to wrap the underlying operation
in a straightforward manner.</P>

<P>More interestingly, the template is explicitly specialized for the integral types in the following variations: signed
or unsigned, 1, 2 or 4 bytes.  In these cases, the atomic_counter takes up the same amount of room as the
underlying variable (so it fits into structures where a plain number was expected), and uses special functions
to perform the operations.  This form is two to three times faster than the non-blocking case of using a
Win32 Critical Section, and has the advantage of never having to block.</P>

<P>This code uses the assembly language primitives that are the basis of all such atomic operations.  This is
as efficient as you can get to accomplish this result, but be warned that it's not a cheap instruction.  Benchmarks
show that it's orders of magnitude slower than normal non-synchronized arithmetic on integers (about 100 nanoseconds
compared to 2 nanoseconds).  So, don't use atomic counters gratuitously.  They are cheaper than general
purpose synchronization primitives, but if you have 3 or more atomic counters it would be more efficient to use
a Critical Section instead.</p>

<P>This class works for .NET "managed extensions" in VC++ version 7.1.  That is, the entire Repertoire library compiles "using the CLR",
and this class is no exception.  However, it provides __fastcall in the normal case, which is not available in "managed" code.  So it
swtiches to a normal function signature in this case.</P>

<P>This class detects the case when there is only one CPU present, and disables the locking, speeding up the
access.  This is done at run-time if it detects this case.  Basically, the atomic instructions are in fact single
instructions, and any interrupt (or time-slice change) will not occur in the middle of it.  The read-modify-write
instruction is all that is needed when there is only one CPU.  Only with multithreading under multiple CPUs is the
bus-locking and pipeline-flushing necessary.  Note however that a bus-mastering device other than a CPU
causes the same problem, so this class will not cooperate with non-CPU access to the memory location, when
the single-CPU code is selected.</P>
