<H2 id="overview">What Is A Closure?</H1>

<P>In C++, you can have a pointer to a member function.  This requires an instance to be called
upon, so the syntax is:</P>

<PRE class="code">
(instance.*ptr)(args)
</PRE>

<P>When you call a member function normally, the syntax is:</P>

<PRE class="code">
instance.member(args)
</PRE>

<P>Normally, every expression in C++ has a well-defined type.  But what is <code>instance.*ptr</code>
and what is <code>instance.member</code>?  They are clearly subexpressions in that they are made up
of more primitive things and an operator, and the resulting thing is something that is used as part of
a function call, which is itself classified as a <I>postfix expression</I>.</P>

<P>Clearly it is something, but what is it?  It is called a <I>class closure</I> and is something that has
very little support in C++.  That is, the only thing you can do with it is call the function right away.  You can’t
save the result in a variable and use it later, e.g.</P>

<PRE class="code">
<I>// hypothetical code, not legal C++!</I>
p1= instance.*ptr;
p1(args);

p2= &instance.member;
p2 (args);
</PRE>

<P>This looks like it should work, if only there was some way in C++ to define <code>p1</code> or <code>p2</code>.
This incomplete feature is referred to as a class closure by Stroustrup and others who speculate on such
things.</P>

<P>When I need to give a callback pointer to Windows, such as for a WinProc, what I really want is <code>p2</code>,
so I can use a member of a specific object.  This module in Classics provides this capability.</P>

<H2>Using a Closure</H2>
<P>The file <code>Classics/closure_UT.cxx</code> illustrates the use of a class closure.</P>

<PRE class="code">
typedef int (__stdcall callback_t) (int);
callback_t* callback;

&hellip;

<I>//Normal set-up of a pointer to a function.</I>
callback= &callback1;
<I>//And use it.</I>
y= callback(x);

<I>//Here is my magic:</I>
<I>// I really want to say  callback= &object.member</I>
<I>//But I get the same result with:</I>
member_callback_thunk&lt;C,int,int> thunk (&object, &C::member);
callback= thunk.callptr();
<I>//And use it.</I>
y= callback(x);
</PRE>

<P>In this example, code that only knows about normal pointers to functions can be given
the function created by <code>thunk.callptr()</code> and it will work, calling
<code>object.member</code> when invoked.  Note that this is not the same as using
STL to make functors that are triggered with the same function calling syntax as normal
functions.  This is really a normal function!  It can be passed to code that is
already compiled and expecting a pointer to a regular function.  This specifically includes
the WinProc and any of the Enum... API functions in Windows.</P>

<P>Basically, the template <code>member_callback_thunk</code> holds a pointer to
an object and a pointer-to-member of a member function.  If this class had an <code>operator()</code>
defined on it, it would be a functor as used with STL.  But instead, it has <code>callptr()</code>.</P>

<P>The instance of the <code>member_callback_thunk</code>, called <code>thunk</code> in the
example above, causes a function to exist.  This normal (non-member) function contains code to
call the member on the object, with the same argument.  <code>callptr</code> gives you a
pointer to this function.</P>

<P><IMG src="../images/oneway-sign-50U.png" ALIGN="right" ALT="One Way road sign" TITLE="This icon indicates that you must create objects in the proscribed manner">The function is dynamically generated to match the specific object and member needed, and it
exists within the <code>member_callback_thunk</code> object.  When the destructor is called,
the function you got from <code>callptr</code> isn’t any good anymore.</P>

<H2 id="member_callback_thunk">Using the <code>member_callback_thunk</code> template</H2>

<H3 id="limitations">Limitations</H3>

<H4>The member must be <code>__thiscall</code></H4>

<P>Member functions, in Microsoft’s compiler, other than those with ellipses, are normally
passed using the <code>__thiscall</code> calling convention.  Only by specifiying otherwise
does it do something different.  The code is necessarily specific to how the function expects
to pass arguments, return, and manage the stack.</P>

<P>It would be possible to write
additional templates for other calling conventions, but that’s not a priority.  A work-around
is to create a member function that is a one-line wrapper.  For example, see the members
in the <A HREF="../class_summary.html#atomic_counter">atomic_counter</A>, which
are available both as <code>__fastcall</code> and as the default <code>__thiscall</code>.</P>

<H4>The resulting closure is <code>__stdcall</code></H4>
<P>The code is necessarily specific to how the function expects to pass arguments, return, and
manage the stack.  I chose to implement only the <code>__stdcall</code> case, but
additional templates could certainly be created for other cases.  Providing for more calling
conventions for both member and thunk results in an explosion of combinations, since each
pair needs unique code.  Furthermore, C++ doesn’t have overloading based on calling convention
so you would need to specify these things (correctly!) when creating a thunk.  In short, it’s easier
all around to not have them unless they really are needed.</P>

<P>The Windows operating system uses <code>__stdcall</code> for its API entry points.
COM uses it.  DLL exports are assumed to use it.  Windows callbacks use it.  Since providing
a thunk for outside code (e.g. Windows callbacks) is the main point (for stuff within C++ we
can just use functors without problems), <code>__stdcall</code> is the way to go.</P>

<H4>Nonstandard and Compiler Specific</H4>

<P>Since this is not something that is possible in C++, the implementation <I>must</I> be
non-standard and therefore compiler-specific.  If you want to supply code for other compilers, I’ll
be happy to merge it in.  Note that the <code>closure.h</code> file just includes the proper
implementation, and each implementation goes in its own file.  That is, each file is written
for the platform rather than having a nest of conditional compilation.</P>

<H3 id="argcount">How Many Arguments?</H3>

<P>You need to use a different class name for each count of arguments to the function.
For example,</P>

<PRE class="code">
 int out1= object.call3(12,3.14,'a'); <I>// member takes three arguments.</I>
 member_callback_thunk_<B>3</B>&lt;C,int, int,double,char> thunk (&object, &C::call3);
 int (__stdcall *callback3)(int, double, char)= thunk.callptr();
 int output= callback3 (12, 3.14, 'a'); <I>// thunk takes three arguments also.</I>
</PRE>

<P>The template class <code>member_callback_thunk_3</code> is for functions that
take three arguments, The template class <code>member_callback_thunk_12</code> is for functions that
take 12 arguments, etc.</P>

<P>You need to specify the types of all the arguments to the template.  Since template classes
can’t be overloaded based on different number of arguments, the simplest thing is to give them
different names.</P>

<H4>Where are they declared?</H4>

<P>The template class <code>member_callback_thunk_3</code> is in the header file
<code>"classics\closure-3.h"</code>, the template class <code>member_callback_thunk_99</code> is in the header file
<code>"classics\closure-99.h"</code>, etc.  Each count is in a header by itself, named with the count also.</P>

<P>But where is the file <code>"classics\closure-867.h"</code>?  They are not to be seen in the directory when Classics
is installed.  Instead, they are generated using the program <code>ThunkN.perl</code>.  Each variation is a simple
mechanical change from the basic class, amounting to how many <code>ParamType<I>n</I></code>’s are listed in each
place that lists them.  Since C++ doesn’t have meta-templates that let you change the number of parameters, and
preprocessor macros have neither iteration nor recursion, while Perl is born to do text manipulations, I used Perl.  The program
copies the basic definition from the header and adds more parameters.  So, any change to the basic definition is
automatically reflected in the copies.</P>

<P>If you desire to include <code>"closure-867.h"</code>, go to the Classics source directory and run
<PRE class="screencaption">Command</PRE>
<PRE class="screenshot">
<span class="prompt">[blah\blah\blah\classics]</span> ThunkN 867
        <I>or perhaps</I>
<span class="prompt">[blah\blah\blah\classics]</span> perl.exe ThunkN.perl 867
</PRE>

<P>If you don’t have <A HREF="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/" TARGET="extern">Perl</A>, it’s probably 
easier to just replace all occurances of <code>ParamType</code> using your text editor, since that’s all there 
is to it.  Look at the existing <code>classics\closure-3.h"</code> for an example.</P>

<H4>But you only need one</H4>

<P>If you have more than one argument, you can
declare the function to take a single <code>struct</code> instead.  Make the memory layout of the
structure on the stack the same as what passing multiple arguments would be.  For the WinProc, I
ended up liking it better this way!</P>

<H4>Zero arguments</H4>

<P>If you have no arguments, use <code>member_callback_thunk_0</code> declared in
<code>"classics\closure-0.h"</code>.</P>


<H3 id="constvolatile">Const and Volatile Members</H3>


<H2 id="others">Other kinds of thunks</H2>

<P>The provided code centers on getting a normal <code>__stdcall</code> pointer to
call a member function of a particular instance.  Other things are possible, such as adding
a parameter to a function (called <I>currying</I> in some languages).  However, before
getting very far in experimenting with other kinds, I realized that I can always design the code
to use a member function.  Once the thunking capability exists in any form, the rest can be
done within the C++ language.</P>

<H2 id="internals">Internals: How It Works (Microsoft VC++)</H2>

<P><A HREF="#after_internals">[skip it]</A></P>

<H3>Basic Thunk</H3>
<P>The real magic is done with the <code>closure_stdcall_to_thiscall</code>
class.  The idea is that the code to call exists inside the instance.</P>
<P>To create the code, I use a structure.  The layout of the structure is such
that the object’s address and the member function’s address (or values computed
simply from them) slide right in where they are needed in the code.  Around them, I
defined fields whose name reflects the assembly language opcodes to be placed
in them.</P>
<P>Once the structure is populated with the values and the opcodes, the
address of that structure can be cast to a function pointer!</P>

<H3>Different Grades of Member Pointers</H3>
<P>The compiler generates pointers to member functions in three different ways.
In the simpest case, it is simply a pointer to the function.  If the member is
virtual, it points to a VCALL Thunk generated by the compiler that does the
virtual lookup.  In any case, all that needs to be done is to load
the <code>ECX</code> register with the object’s <code>this</code> pointer and jump to the function
pointed to.</P>

<P>In the case of multiple inheritence, things are a little more complicated.
Not every base class can be at the same address of the drived class, so
all base classes other than the first need a <I>this adjustment</I> when
calling a function implemented in that base.  That is, when calling a member
that’s inherited, the <code>this</code> pointer needs to be adjusted to point to the
proper base object.  In single inheritence, the adjustment is always zero.
With multiple inheritence, the member pointer dereference code needs to
take care of this.</P>

<P>So, a pointer to a member in this case contains two fields.  The first
is a pointer to the entry point, and the second is a constant to add to 
<code>this</code> before calling it.  Since a pointer to a member can hold different
members at different times, this needs to be done at run time.
However, since my thunk is bound to a specific object, rather than
being called on different objects at different times, I can do that
calculation at initialization time.  That is, the thunk is exactly as in
the simpler case, and the object pointer is pointing to the correct
base object already.</P>

<P>With virtual base classes, things are even more complex.
The location of a particular base class can vary from instance
to instance (since the instance may really be of some
further-derived class).  If the member to call is inherited from
one of those virtual bases that like to move around, the code
to locate the base uses lookups from the vtable in the object.
Since the pointer can point to different members at different
times, it must also note which base class contains the member
being pointed to.</P>

<P>So, the pointer to member in this case contains three
fields. The first is again the actual function entry point.
The third is involved with looking up the virtual base’s
location.  The second is again a <code>this</code> adjustment, applied
after locating the correct virtual base, in case the member
is inherited from some non-virtual base class of the virtual base.
Sound complicated?  It gets worse!  The code to do the
call also contains a constant known at compile time, which
is dependant on the declared class type and how it’s layed out.
I cannot write code to call a member pointer, since there is no way
to determine this other constant from the class name alone and
information provided through the C++ language (which is basically
the <code>sizeof</code> the final class and the location of the very beginning of
the most-complete object).</P>

<P>To get around this, I have the compiler figure it out for me.
The code in <code>create_probe</code> sets up a pointer
to a member with the same adjustment values, but points
to a &ldquo;fake&rdquo; member function.  Then the template, which
expands into the proper code for the types given, performs
the <code>->*</code> operator that only it knows how to
do.  But it calls my function!  My function simply notes the
address of <code>this</code>.  Now, I know the correct subobject for the
given object and the real member, and once again set up
the most simple thunk with this information.</P>

<H3>Efficient, No Matter What</H3>

<P>You’ll notice that calling a thunk is more efficient than calling
a normal pointer to a member function!  Because the object is
fixed, the calculations are done once, when the thunk is created,
rather than every time it is called.  The thunks are just as efficient
for calling back things in fancy virtual inheritence trees as they
are with the simplest class.</P>

<P>There is a slight difference at initialization time, though.
The single and multiple inheritence cases call a non-template
function.  Only one function exists, no matter how many
types are instantiated.</P>

<P>The virtual inheritence case requires that the <code>->*</code>
operation be generated by the template, knowing the correct object
type.  So, a different helper function is generated for every
object class, though different parameter and return types can
share one.  However, it is inlined anyway.  Basically, the
initialization requires more code than for the other cases: it performs
the <code>->*</code> call, and one more additional call compared
with the non-virtual-base case.</P>

<A NAME="after_internals"></A>
<H2 id="how_fast">How Fast Is It?</H2>

<P>The code present in the generated thunk contains two instructions:</P>

<PRE class="code">
mov ECX, object  <I>; mov immediate</I>
jmp target <I>; jmp relative immediate</I>
</PRE>

<P>That’s the same amount of code as the compiler’s VCALL thunk.  With only
two instructions it’s hard to get simpler: calling a function in a DLL goes through
an extra jump too, but does not need to load a register.</P>

<P>By all rights, this ought to be extremely fast, and is certainly as fast as is possible to
accomplish this.  But measuring the actual speed is problematic.  Because of the
nature of the modern superscaler CPUs, trying to measure a bunch of copies of
this code gives funny results.  For example, making the called function do one more
layer of recursion made it run almost twice as fast!  It only makes sence to time it
when the CPU is doing other things, not just millions of concecutive calls.  If the
called function is realistic in its complexity, the overhead of the thunk is not even
measurable with a simple timing program.</P>
