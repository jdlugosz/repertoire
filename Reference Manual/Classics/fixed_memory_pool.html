<H1>static_fixed_memory_pool and ts_static_fixed_memory_pool</H1>

<P>The <CODE>static_fixed_memory_pool</CODE> manages an <A HREF="#performance">efficient</A> heap of
fixed-size objects. Since all instances of a class are the same size, this
is ideal for implementing a class-specific <CODE>operator new</CODE> and
<CODE>operator delete</CODE>.</P>

<A NAME="1"><H2>General</H2></A>
    
    <P>The <CODE>static_fixed_memory_pool</CODE> class is not thread-safe (it
      has <A HREF="../threadcat.html">I-OTT</A> semantics), because a class
      that is itself OTT or higher may draw upon it, and thread safety is
      unnecessary in this situation. The purpose of this class is to be fast,
      and the presence of a critical section slows it down enormously because
      it's so simple to begin with.</P>
    
    <P>The <CODE>ts_static_fixed_memory_pool</CODE> is a thread-safe version.
      Use this to allow safe free-threaded access to the heap.</P>
    
    <P>These classes are specially designed for use as class-specific memory
      managers, especially for primitive types used deep inside the system (such
      as the smart pointer's internals). To this end, it <I>must</I> be usable
      at any time, even before Classics' static variables have constructed, even
      before Classics' DllMain has been called.</P>
    
    <P>Because it will appear as a static member of such a class, it can't be
      set up using a constructor because that would mean the heap can't be used
      before its own static constructor is called. So there is no constructor at
      all, and the implementation relies on all-zero initialization of static
      objects at image load time. That is why it's named <CODE><B>static</B>_fixed_memory_pool</CODE>,
      to emphasize that it's designed for use as a static member.</P>
    
    <P>In addition, the class provides some minimal support for auditing and
      debugging memory leaks, without adding significantly to the overhead or
      requiring a special debug version.</P>
    
    <P>As mentioned above, there is no constructor. An instance must be
      declared as a static variable or static member, or explicitly filled with
      zeros, in order to work properly.</P>
    
    <P>To allocate memory, call <B><CODE>void* alloc(int size)</CODE></B>.
      The <CODE>size</CODE> parameter is only significant the first time alloc
      is called! This finishes up the self-initialization of the heap,
      programming it with the size of the object it will be managing. Subsequent
      calls must use the same size.</P>
    
    <P>To free memory, call <B><CODE>void free(void*)</CODE></B>.</P>
    
    <P>In addition, there is a <B><CODE>void clean()</CODE></B> function that
      tries to release unneeded memory back to the system. The ability to
      support this kind of incremental cleaning is fundamental to the design. To
      understand the need, consider an example: you have a peak load of a
      million nodes, but then traffic slows down and you only need a thousand.
      But there are still 900,000 unused nodes on its internal free list. Most
      fixed-size heaps (including that of STL) have no provision to release this
      memory until <I>all</I> nodes are freed. But in this case, a large number
      of nodes (though not all the unused nodes) can be released back to the
      system.</P>
    
<A NAME="2"><H2>Using as a class-specific memory manager</H2></A>
    
<P> The <CODE>static_fixed_memory_pool</CODE> (and <CODE>ts_static_fixed_memory_pool</CODE>)
      class is specifically meant to be used to implement a class-specific
      allocator. </P>
    
    <H3>Implement operator new and operator delete</H3>
    
<P>You can use it directly, implementing a class's <CODE>operator new</CODE> and
<CODE>operator delete</CODE> to use the a fixed memory pool. Since it was
designed for this use in mind, it is rather simple:</P>

<PRE>
class C {
public:
   static ts_static_fixed_memory_pool <B>pool</B>;
   static void* <B>operator new</B> (size_t size) { return pool.alloc (size); }
   static void <B>operator delete</B> (void* p)  { pool.free(p); }
   //...etc.
</PRE>
    
<P>The basic principle is to implement <CODE>operator new</CODE> and
<CODE>operator delete</CODE> to simply call the <CODE>alloc</CODE> and
<CODE>free</CODE> functions of a <CODE>static_fixed_memory_pool</CODE>
object.</P>
    
<P>Typically, the <CODE>static_fixed_memory_pool</CODE> object will be
intended for use with this one class alone, so that can be declared as a
static member of the class, too (remember to define it in a .CPP file
somewhere). However, you could have more than one class share the same
<CODE>static_fixed_memory_pool</CODE> object, as long as they are all the
same size.</P>
    
<H3>A canned Solution</H3>
    
<P>It would seem that adding three members to a class, especially when
exactly the same text is used every time, is something that can be
provided as a unit. There are actually some technical difficultites in
doing this, but a mix-in class <CODE>pool_mixin</CODE> (and <CODE>ts_pool_mixin</CODE>
for the thread-safe version) is provided for this purpose.</P>
    
<P>Ideally, the class simply contains the same three members discussed
above. To use it, make it a base class and all three members get added to
your class.</P>
    
<P>That's the theory anyway. The technical problem is that if it were done this way,
all classes using the mix-in would share the same static data
member. That will not work. Instead, each class needs its own <CODE>fixed_memory_pool</CODE>,
which means it must declare its own static data member. To get around
this, each class can mix-in a <I>different</I> base class. This is easily
done with a template. This example usage can be found in
<code>memory_pool_benchmark.cxx</code>:</P>

<PRE>
class C2 : public <B>classics::pool_mixin</B>&lt;C2&gt; {
   const void* addr;
   int value;
public:
   C2 (int x) : addr(this), value(x) {}
   };
</PRE>

<P>The template argument given to <code>pool_mixin</code> doesn't do anything.  It's just there
to allow the use of a template to generate as many unique base classes as may be needed.  Each
different value for the template parameter produces a different specialization of <code>pool_mixin</code>, and
therefore a different static data member.</P>

<P>Use the class itself as the template parameter, and you know it will be different in every class.</P>

<P>As seen in the memory_pool_benchmark.cxx example program, this is easy to use and works
properly in an application program.  However, there is a serious restriction on its use due to the way
templates work in the compiler.</P>

<P>The template's members are instantiated in each translation unit (.CPP file) in which they are needed.
The linker then eliminates duplicates.  When defining a normal static member, you declare it in the
header file inside the class, but still have to define it in one .CPP file.  For the classes generated by
the templates, there is no "one place" where the static member is defined.</P>

<P>In a single program, this is not a problem, since all you care is that one exists somewhere.  But
a program with DLL's is actually linked as several independent execution image files.  Each DLL will
contain its own copy of the static member.  Doing it manually, you can define it in one DLL and import
it into all the others.  For the classes generated by the template, you get a copy in each DLL and in
the main EXE.  So, if <code>operator new</code> is invoked in one DLL (or the main EXE) and 
<code>operator delete</code> is invoked in a different one, things won't work right.</P>

<P>The bottom line:  Use this mix-in in a code that will go into the EXE only; that is, when writing a program.
Think carefully before using it when writing a DLL.  Since the use of the mix-in only saves four simple lines
of code, it's not worth coming up with a better and more complex solution.</P>
    
<A NAME="3"><H2>Testing and Debugging</H2></A>
    
    <P>We all know that sometimes using the &quot;debug version&quot; makes the
      problem go away, and Classics follows the philosophy of &quot;The first
      rule of testing is build something testable.&quot; </P>
    
    <P>In order to test this class, a debugging hook is provided. The member
      <CODE>callback</CODE> points to a function which will be called at
      various strategic points in the class's execution. This provides a way to
      monitor the class's behavior, without causing a significant amount of
      additional overhead when the hook is not needed.</P>
    
    <P>An example can be found in <CODE>handle_UT.cxx</CODE>. The line <BR>
    <CODE>classics::lifetime::pool.callback=
      callback;</CODE><BR>
      if un-commented, will enable callbacks to this function:</P>

<PRE>
void callback (int mode, void* p)
 {
 static bool internal= false;
 static int counter= 0;
 counter++;
 switch (mode) {
    case 1:
       if (!internal)  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;mem &quot; &lt;&lt; p &lt;&lt; &quot; alloc [&quot; &lt;&lt; counter &lt;&lt; &quot;]\n&quot;;
       break;
    case 2:
       if (!internal)  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;mem &quot; &lt;&lt; p &lt;&lt; &quot; free  [&quot; &lt;&lt; counter &lt;&lt; &quot;]\n&quot;;
       break;
    case 3:
       internal= true;
       break;
    case 4:
       internal= false;
       break;
    }
 }
</PRE>
    
    <P>Calls with code values of 1 and 2 indicate allocations and frees,
      respectively, as you can see from the implementation of <CODE>fixed_memory_pool::alloc</CODE>
      and <CODE>fixed_memory_pool::free</CODE>. Values of 3 and 4 are more
      difficult to understand. If you study the implementation of <CODE>fixed_memory_pool::newchunk</CODE>,
      you can see that these calls bracket the calling of <CODE>alloc</CODE> or
      <CODE>free</CODE> that is not a direct result of the user's request. In
      the sample reporting code above, they turn reporting off and back on
      again.</P>

<A NAME="performance"><H2>Performance</H2></A>

<P>Why bother using a custom allocator in a class?  Run <code>memory_pool_benchmark.cxx</code> and
you'll find out that the fixed memory pool is <I>much</I> faster than the standard new/delete code.  On my
machine, I get:</P>

<TABLE BORDER>
<TR>
	<TH>version<TH>time<TH>adj. time<TH>relative speed
<TR>
	<TD>stub (no allocation)
	<TD>40
	<TD>0
<TR>
	<TD>regular new/delete
	<TD>2733
	<TD>2693
	<TD>defined as 1
<TR>
	<TD>fixed pool
	<TD>260
	<TD>220
	<TD>12 ¼ ×
<TR>
	<TD>thread-safe fixed pool
	<TD>1090
	<TD>1050
	<TD>2 ½ ×
</TABLE>

<P>This benchmark is rather generous toward the performance of the regular memory manager.  Because
nearly a million calls were made to allocate and free the same sized block, the heap became filled
with blocks of that size, so one was easily found.  Under a mixed load, the general-purpose allocator
is slower.</P>

<P>So, if you use a fixed block pool to implement a custom allocator for a class, you can expect it
to allocate/free 2 to 3 times faster.  Furthermore, future improvements may significantly increase its speed.  If
you don't need thread safety, skipping the very expensive mutual-exclusion code gives you a wopping
12 times speedup.</P>
