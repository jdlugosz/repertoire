<H2 id="General">General</H2>

    <P>These classes are specially designed for use as class-specific memory
      managers, especially for primitive types used deep inside the system (such
      as the smart pointer’s internals). To this end, it <I>must</I> be usable
      at any time, even before Classics' static variables have constructed, even
      before Classics’ DllMain has been called.</P>

    <P>
      Because it will appear as a static member of such a class, it can’t be
      set up using a constructor because that would mean the heap could not be used
      before its own static constructor is called. So there is no constructor at
      all, and <B>the implementation relies on all-zero initialization of static
      objects at image load time</B>. That is why it’s named <CODE><B>static</B>_fixed_memory_pool</CODE>,
      to emphasize that it’s designed for use as a static member.</P>

    <P>In addition, the class provides some minimal support for auditing and
      debugging memory leaks, without adding significantly to the overhead or
      requiring a special debug version.</P>

    <P><IMG src="../images/oneway-sign-50U.png" ALIGN="right" ALT="[One Way!]" TITLE="This icon indicates that you must create objects in the proscribed manner">
      As mentioned above, there is no constructor. An instance must be
      declared as a static variable or static member, or explicitly filled with
      zeros, in order to work properly.</P>

    <P>To allocate memory, call <B><CODE>void* alloc(int size)</CODE></B>.
      The <CODE>size</CODE> must use the same size on every call
      to this object.</P>

    <P>To free memory, call <B><CODE>void free(void*)</CODE></B>.</P>

    <P>In addition, there is a <B><CODE>void clean()</CODE></B> function that
      tries to release unneeded memory back to the system. The ability to
      support this kind of incremental cleaning is fundamental to the design. To
      understand the need, consider an example: you have a peak load of a
      million nodes, but then traffic slows down and you only need a thousand.
      But there are still 900,000 unused nodes on its internal free list. Most
      fixed-size heaps (including that of STL) have no provision to release this
      memory until <I>all</I> nodes are freed. But in this case, a large number
      of nodes (though not all the unused nodes) can be released back to the
      system. <span class="prognote">This feature is not implemented yet.</span></P>

<H2 id="threads">Thread Safety</H2>

<P>The <CODE>static_fixed_memory_pool</CODE> class is not thread-safe (it
has <A HREF="../threadcat.html">I-OTT</A> semantics), because a class
that is itself OTT or higher may draw upon it, and thread safety is
unnecessary in this situation. The purpose of this class is to be fast,
and the presence of a critical section slows it down enormously because
it’s so simple to begin with.</P>

<P>The <CODE>ts_static_fixed_memory_pool</CODE> is a thread-safe version.
Use this to allow safe free-threaded access to the heap.</P>

<P>These are both derived from the <code>general_static_fixed_memory_pool</code>, which
can have thread-safety turned on and off on the fly during run-time by assigning to the <code>single_thread_only</code>
member.</P>

<P>Using the <code>general_static_fixed_memory_pool</code> is thread-safe by default.
The <code>static_fixed_memory_pool</code>, in addition to eliminating the need to specify the template argument or empty <code>&lt;&gt;</code>,
turns thead-safe functioning off at the first opportunity.</P>

<P>The <code>ts_static_fixed_memory_pool</code> derives from <code>general_static_fixed_memory_pool&lt;&gt;</code> also,
but leaves the thread-safety turned on.  Currently, it doesn’t do anything else.  However, a future version may supply
more features to optimize threading speed.</P>

<H2 id="ordering">No Order Dependancies</H2>

<P>A design feature of these classes is that they support static constructors and destructors.
That is, initialization code before <code>main</code> is called might need to call <code>static_fixed_memory_pool::alloc</code>.
Not only is the order of initialization not defined, so that an object’s constructor may try to call <code>pool.alloc</code>
before <code>pool</code> itself is constructed; but the pool may be in a different DLL than the object
that uses it, and the order of initialization of DLLs is unspecified!</P>

<P>That is why this class is designed to be zero-filled and not have a run-time constructor called.  It
will be ready to go as soon as the program image loads.</P>

<P>Likewise, the order of destruction is undefined, both within one library and between DLLs.
Yet, we don’t want to simply abandon the memory:  This would certainly work&mdash;why bother
freeing it back to the operating system if the process is about to terminate anyway?  But doing so
bothers people who run tools like Bounds Checker or otherwise look for memory leaks in their
code.</P>

<P>So, it is a design feature that the <code>callback</code> is called for every item freed, even if during static
destruction; and the underlying large chunks are explicitly returned to the OS at program termination.</P>

<P>A related feature is what happens if <code>alloc</code> is called during the program shutdown, after the pool
has already been destroyed?  This is also supported.  It will fill the request gracefully.</P>

<H2 id="class-specific">Using as a class-specific memory manager</H2>

<P> The <CODE>static_fixed_memory_pool</CODE> (and <CODE>ts_static_fixed_memory_pool</CODE>)
      class is specifically meant to be used to implement a class-specific
      allocator. </P>

    <H3>Implement <code>operator new</code> and <code>operator delete</code></H3>

<P>Using <CODE>static_fixed_memory_pool</CODE> (and <CODE>ts_static_fixed_memory_pool</CODE>)
to implement a class’s <CODE>operator new</CODE> and
<CODE>operator delete</CODE> is rather simple:</P>

<PRE class="code">
class C {
public:
   static ts_static_fixed_memory_pool <B>pool</B>;
   static void* <B>operator new</B> (size_t size) { return pool.alloc (size); }
   static void <B>operator delete</B> (void* p)  { pool.free(p); }
   //...etc.
   };

 <I>// in one CPP file:</I>
 ts_static_fixed_memory_pool C::pool;
</PRE>

<P>The basic principle is to implement <CODE>operator new</CODE> and
<CODE>operator delete</CODE> to simply call the <CODE>alloc</CODE> and
<CODE>free</CODE> functions of a <CODE>static_fixed_memory_pool</CODE>
object.</P>

<P>Typically, the <CODE>static_fixed_memory_pool</CODE> object will be
intended for use with this one class alone, so that can be declared as a
static member of the class, too (remember to define it in a <code>.CPP</code> file
somewhere). However, you could have more than one class share the same
<CODE>static_fixed_memory_pool</CODE> object, as long as they are all the
same size.</P>

<P>A derived class will inherit the <CODE>operator new</CODE> and
<CODE>operator delete</CODE> from the base class.
<IMG src="../images/caution.png" style="height:2em" ALIGN="right" ALT="[caution]" TITLE="This icon indicates special instructions or pitfalls.">
If you derive
from a class that uses the fixed memory pool, and the derived class
is larger, you will get a runtime error when <code>alloc</code> is called
with the wrong size.  Define <CODE>operator new</CODE> and
<CODE>operator delete</CODE> in the derived class as well, to use
a different pool or to go back to the regular heap.</P>

<H3 id="canned">A canned Solution</H3>

<P>It would seem that adding three members to a class, especially when
exactly the same text is used every time, is something that can be
provided as a unit. There are actually some technical difficultites in
doing this, but a mix-in class <CODE>pool_mixin</CODE> (and <CODE>ts_pool_mixin</CODE>
for the thread-safe version) is provided for this purpose.</P>

<P>Ideally, the class simply contains the same three members discussed
above. To use it, make it a base class and all three members get added to
your class.</P>

<P>That’s the theory anyway. The technical problem is that if it were done this way,
all classes using the mix-in would share the same static data
member. Instead, each class needs its own <CODE>fixed_memory_pool</CODE>,
which means it must declare its own static data member. To get around
this, each class can mix-in a <I>different</I> base class. This is easily
done with a template. This example usage can be found in
<code>memory_pool_benchmark.cxx</code>:</P>

<PRE class="code">
class C2 : public <B>classics::pool_mixin</B>&lt;C2&gt; {
   const void* addr;
   int value;
public:
   C2 (int x) : addr(this), value(x) {}
   };
</PRE>

<P>The template argument given to <code>pool_mixin</code> doesn’t do anything.  It’s just there
to allow the use of a template to generate as many unique base classes as may be needed.  Each
different type for the template parameter produces a different specialization of <code>pool_mixin</code>, and
therefore a different static data member.</P>

<P>Use the class itself as the template parameter, and you know it will be different in every class.</P>

<P>As seen in the <code>memory_pool_benchmark.cxx</code> example program, this is easy to use and works
properly in an application program.  However, there is a serious restriction on its use due to the way
templates work in the compiler.</P>

<P>The template’s members are instantiated in each translation unit (<code>.CPP</code> file) in which they are needed.
The linker then eliminates duplicates.  When defining a normal static member, you declare it in the
header file inside the class, but still have to define it in one <code>.CPP</code> file file.  For the classes generated by
the templates, there is no &ldquo;one place&rdquo; where the static member is defined.</P>

<P>In a single program, this is not a problem, since all you care is that one exists somewhere.  But
a program with DLLs is actually linked as several independent execution image files.  Each DLL will
contain its own copy of the static member.  Doing it manually, you can define it in one DLL and import
it into all the others.  For the classes generated by the template, you get a copy in each DLL and in
the main EXE.  So, if <code>operator new</code> is invoked in one DLL (or the main EXE) and
<code>operator delete</code> is invoked in a different one, things won’t work right.</P>

<P>
<IMG src="../images/caution.png" style="height:2em" ALIGN="right" ALT="[caution]" TITLE="This icon indicates special instructions or pitfalls.">
The bottom line:  Use this mix-in in a code that will go into the EXE only; that is, when writing a program.
Think carefully before using it when writing a DLL.  Since the use of the mix-in only saves four simple lines
of code, it’s not worth coming up with a better and more complex solution.</P>

<H2 id="testing">Testing and Debugging</H2>

    <P>We all know that sometimes using the &ldquo;debug version&rdquo; makes the
      problem go away, and Classics follows the philosophy of &ldquo;The first
      rule of testing is build something testable.&rdquo; </P>

<H3>Callback Hook</H3>

    <P>In order to test this class, a debugging hook is provided. The member
      <B><CODE>callback</CODE></B> points to a function which will be called at
      various strategic points in the class’s execution. This provides a way to
      monitor the class’s behavior, without causing a significant amount of
      additional overhead when the hook is not needed.</P>

    <P>An example can be found in <CODE>handle_UT.cxx</CODE>. The line <BR>
    <CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;classics::lifetime::pool.callback=
      callback;</CODE><BR>
      if un-commented, will enable callbacks to this function:</P>

<PRE class="code">
void callback (int mode, void* p)
 {
 static bool internal= false;
 static int counter= 0;
 counter++;
 switch (mode) {
    case 1:
       if (!internal)  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;mem &quot; &lt;&lt; p &lt;&lt; &quot; alloc [&quot; &lt;&lt; counter &lt;&lt; &quot;]\n&quot;;
       break;
    case 2:
       if (!internal)  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;mem &quot; &lt;&lt; p &lt;&lt; &quot; free  [&quot; &lt;&lt; counter &lt;&lt; &quot;]\n&quot;;
       break;
    case 3:
       internal= true;
       break;
    case 4:
       internal= false;
       break;
    }
 }
</PRE>

    <P>Calls with code values of 1 and 2 indicate allocations and frees,
      respectively, as you can see from the implementation of <CODE>fixed_memory_pool::alloc</CODE>
      and <CODE>fixed_memory_pool::free</CODE>. Values of 3 and 4 are no longer used.</P>


<P><IMG src="../images/caution.png" style="height:2em" ALIGN="right" ALT="[caution]" TITLE="This icon indicates special instructions or pitfalls.">
If compiled using the <code>/CLR</code> switch to run under the .NET virtual machine,
the <code>callback</code> must be cleared (set the pointer to 0) before returning from <code>main</code>.</P>


<H3>“Internal” Data</H3>

<P>The following member data and functions are available for testing, debugging, trouble-shooting, and performance
monitoring.  They are not part of the “normal” interface, and should only be used for these auxilary purposes.</P>

<DL>
<DT>use_count
<DD><P>This shows how many objects have been returned by <code>alloc</code> but not yet <code>free</code>'d.</P>
<DT>callback
<DD><P>Set this to your callback function, explained above.</P>
<DT>wait_count
<DD><P>Indicates how many times a function has needed to wait for another thread before it could proceed.  For
unit testing, seeing a non-zero value proves that you did in fact have threads get in each other’s way during testing.</P>
<DT>get_nodelist()
<DD><P>This exposes (read-only) the internal <code>nodelist</code> member.  Note that the type it returns is
not defined in the header.</P>
<DT>get_Recsize()
<DD><P>This returns the size of the objects allocated by this pool.  It is set when the first <code>alloc</code> is made.</P>
<DT>get_chunklist()
<DD><P>This exposes (read-only) the internal <code>chunklist</code> member.  Note that the type it returns is
not defined in the header.</P>
<DT>check_address()
<DD><P>This returns true if the argument is a pointer to a record that is part of this pool.  It reports that the pointer
<I>could</I> be something that was returned by <code>alloc</code> (though it might currently be on the free list).  On a valid
pointer, this will reliably distinguish whether it was allocated on this pool as opposed to allocated by some other means.</P>
</DL>

<H3>Heap Checking</H3>

<P>There are functions for validating the integrety of the pool, for debugging.  A call to check_heap will tell you that
something was freed twice, a freed object was written to (the first four bytes anyway), or other stray pointer problems.
It is intended as a debugging aid, not a perminant part of a program.</P>

<P>There are two implementations:  The normal way, and a fast way that can be useful if a program contains
a very large number of checks.  The normal/FAST_HEAP_CHECK behavior can be enabled on a per-instance basis, using the template
argument to <code>general_static_fixed_memory_pool</code>.</P>

<P>These functions are also thread-safe, but unlike simultainious calls to <code>alloc</code> and <code>free</code>,
these may cause other threads to be locked out of using this pool for a more substantial period of time.
</P>

<DL>
<DT>check_heap()
<DD>
<P>This examines the freelist and reports <code>false</code> if any problems were found.  The normal form will
traverse the freelist and call check_address on each node, and also make sure the linked list doesn’t point
back to itself forming a closed loop.</P>
<P>The <I>FAST_HEAP_CHECK</I> form does not have to call <code>check_address()</code> on every free node, but simply
makes a checksum of all the nodes present.  If enabled, each <code>alloc</code> or <code>free</code> incrementally
adjusts the expected checksum, so those operations are slightly more expensive.</P>

</DD>
<DT>check_heap_p()
<DD><P>This is similar to <code>check_heap()</code>, but returns the address of the bad node rather than
just false.  It returns <code>0</code> if nothing wrong was found.  In addition, it returns the special values <code>1</code>
if the freelist is empty, or <code>2</code> if an infinite loop is detected.</P>
<P>This form is unaffected by the FAST_HEAP_CHECK option.  By its nature, it has to do a full check.  When using
the fast <code>check_heap()</code>, you can follow it up with <code>check_heap_p()</code> if an error is detected.
Or, you can do fast checks more often and a full check every once in a while.</P>
</DL>


<H2 id="performance">Performance</H2>

<h3>Original</H3>
<P>Why bother using a custom allocator in a class?  Run <code>memory_pool_benchmark.cxx</code> and
you’ll find out that the fixed memory pool is <I>much</I> faster than the standard new/delete code.  On my
machine when originally developed (in 1998 I think), I get:</P>

	<TD>2 ½ ×
</TABLE>

<P>This benchmark is rather generous toward the performance of the regular memory manager.  Because
nearly a million calls were made to allocate and free the same sized block, the heap became filled
with blocks of that size, so one was easily found.  Under a mixed load, the general-purpose allocator
is slower.</P>

<P>So, if you use a fixed block pool to implement a custom allocator for a class, you can expect it
to allocate/free 2 to 3 times faster.  Furthermore, future improvements may significantly increase its speed.  If
you don’t need thread safety, skipping the very expensive mutual-exclusion code gives you a wopping
12 times speedup.</P>

<H3>October 2004</H3>

<P>The performance gain is not as dramatic as it once was.  Thanks to improvements in
Microsoft’s implementation of heap management in VC++ 7.1 compared to their older
compilers, and/or improvements to the implementation of the Win32 functions <code>HeapAlloc</code>/<code>HeapFree</code>
in Windows XP compared to older versions of Windows, the compiler-supplied allocation is
more efficient than it used to be.</P>

<P>My understanding of the improvements to the Win32 primitives (though I’ve not benchmarked the more
complex cases) is that it won’t slow down as much under a real load of mixed sizes, compared to older
implementations.</P>

<P>I’ve also discovered that the smart pointer’s load on the pool in some multi-threaded applications
cause more blocking then originally thought.  So a future direction is to improve the thread-safe
version by using a different approach.  Stay tuned...</P>

<H3>June 2006</H3>

<P>The thread-safe code does not use a Win32 <code>CRITICAL_SECTION</code> at all.  A critical section,
by its nature, takes two atomic operations:  one to enter and one to leave.  Furthermore, the enter code
has some complexity to it.  As of PB8, this class manipulates the linked list using only 1 atomic operation
per alloc or free.</P>

<P>If it is set for single-threaded usage, it does not use any atomic operation.  You can switch the need
for thread safety on and off during the program, individually for each pool.</P>
