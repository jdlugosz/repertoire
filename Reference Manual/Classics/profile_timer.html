<H1>profile_timer</H1>
This object provides for obtaining run-time information on the program, idealially suited
for profiling code and running benchmarks.</P>

The members to control the timer are:
<UL>
	<LI><code>start</code> -- starts the timer.
	<LI><code>stop</code> -- stops the timer and makes results available.
	<LI><code>snapshot</code> -- makes current time results available, but does not stop timing.
	<LI><code>reset</code> -- resets the elapsed times to zero.  Does not clear a pending <code>start</code>.
</UL>

<P>The timing information is thread-specific, and in order to get meaningful results, <code>start</code> and
the matching <code>stop</code> must be called from the same thread.</P>

<P>The underlying mechanism is the Win32 call <code>GetThreadTimes</code>, which returns the
amount of time spent actually exeuting this thread.  Time spent in other threads during time-slicing does
not count, and time spent sleeping or blocked does not count.</P>

To obtain results, call
<UL>
	<LI><code>get_user</code> -- time spent in user mode (normal code).
	<LI><code>get_kernel</code> -- time spent in kernel mode (device drivers).
</UL>

The return value of these functions are in milliseconds, although internallay values are kept to higher
precision.
