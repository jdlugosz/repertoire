<H1 id="toptop">APC_server</H1>

<P>It’s fairly easy to start a thread, especially if you simplify the <code>CreateThread</code> function or
encapsulate even more with the <A HREF="launch_thread.html#toptop" class="code">launch_thread</A> class.  But what do you do with a thread once it’s
started?  If you want to send it commands, you have a generic server situation.  This class
does all the work to make a simple server.</P>

<UL>
<LI>You create a server thread by declaring an <code>APC_server</code>.  The actual thread is created
    by the constructor.
<LI>You tell the server to do things by giving it a command object via its <code>send</code> member.
<LI>You shut down the server by calling <code>quit</code> (which will return immediatly), or simply
   by destructing the <code>APC_server</code> object (the destructor blocks until the server thread completes shutdown).
</UL>

<H2>Server Commands</H2>

<P>Dynamically allocate (i.e. use <code>new</code>) an object derived from <A HREF="abstract_command_object.html#toptop" class="code">abstract_command_object</A>.
Pass this pointer to the <code>send</code> function.  The command object is queued and its virtual <code>operator()</code> will
be called eventually.  Then the server deletes the command object.</P>

<P>The command queue is inherantly asynchronous.  If you want to get results back or wait for the command
to complete, you have to provide for that as part of the command object.</P>

<P>Since the command object is deleted by the server, you can’t have it hold result data.  Instead,
include a pointer to the result area in the command object.  You can also include an <A HREF="event_flag.html#toptop" class="code">event_flag</A>
in the command object in order to wait for completion.</P>
