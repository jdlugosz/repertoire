<H2 id="purpose">Purpose for Copy-On-Write Semantics</H2>

<P>A <code>cow</code> handle is intended to appear just like value-based semantics, except that unnecessary copies are
avoided.</P>

<P>Most commonly, this is seen with returning values from functions.  Returning from a function entails copying
the prepared return value out to an area prepared by the caller (using the copy constructor), and then deleting the
original as it goes out of scope.  If the object is large and expesive to copy, this is wasteful.  It would be much
more efficient to just give the caller control over the object that is about to vanish, instead.  A direct way of doing
this is with the <A class="code" href="../../class_summary.html#trug">trug</A> class.  A <code>cow</code> handle is a more
general solution.</P>

<P>When used in this manner, their behavior is simple and it takes very little thought to implement something
that does this, and little thought to understand its nuances.  However, cow handles in Classics can be used
for more general issues, and in advanced or even tricky uses it becomes important to understand the nuances,
and quite benificial to have a library that copes with such details in a useful way.</P>

<H2 id="semantics">Detailed Semantics of C.O.W.</H2>

<H3 id="old_semantics">Old Semantics, prior to <A HREF="../../worklog.html#PB8">PB10</A></H3>

<P>Originally, the meaning of a copy-on-write was that every time such a handle was dereferenced
(using <A class="code" href="../handle.html#operator_arrow">operator-></A> or
<A class="code" href="../handle.html#make_unique">make_unique</A>), it would ensure that no other
cow was sharing the same underlying object.  In PB9, improvements were made to make the meaning
of <A class="code" href="../handle.html#data">data</A> consistent, and a race condition was fixed
regarding overlapping execution of <code>make_unique</code> on the same cow on different threads.</P>

	Illustration of threading issue</div>
</object>

<P>However, further analysis showed that the issue was not unique to overlapping execution of calls to
<code>make_unique</code>, but could still occur, without involving any thread-safety features of any
one function!</P>

<P>The drawing to the left illustrates the events taking place on three threads, all accessing the same
global <code>cow1</code>.</P>

<P>The first thread calls <code>cow1->foo()</code>.  Upon making the call to <code>operator-></code>,
we know that <code>cow1</code> is now uniquely holding its underlying object.  The tail extending downwards
from this point represents the time still inside the execution of <code>foo</code>.</P>

<P>Where the tail turns <span style="color:#D00">red</span>,
the program crashes, citing an access violation inside <code>foo</code>!
What happened?  This would be enough to shake your faith in smart pointers, or at least wonder if global
variables<A HREF="#footnote_global" class="footnoter" target="footer">1</A> are such a good idea.</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>When <code>foo</code> is called, the underlying object (which we'll call <code>Ob1</code>) is referenced only by
<code>cow1</code>, and has an owned reference count of 1.  That's what <code>operator-></code> ensured
before calling <code>foo</code>.</P>
<LI><P>Later, in another thread, a variable <code>cow2</code> is initialized with <code>cow1</code>.  Now they
share <code>Ob1</code>, which has an owned reference count of 2.</P>
<LI><P>Then, <code>cow1</code> is dereferenced again.  Since it is sharing <code>Ob1</code>, it is updated in-place to
point to a fresh clone of <code>Ob1</code>, which we'll call <code>Ob2</code>.  When <code>operator-></code> is
done, <code>cow1</code> points to <code>Ob2</code> and <code>cow2</code> points to <code>Ob1</code>.  The
this pointer of <code>foo</code> is pointing at <code>Ob1</code>, and whether or not <code>foo</code> cares that
<code>cow1</code> has changed is another issue.</P>
<LI><P>Finally, <code>cow2</code> goes out of scope, or gets assigned a different (unrelated) value.  Its underlying object,
<code>Ob1</code>, has its reference count decremented from 1 to zero, triggering object destruction.</P>
</UL>

<P>The <code>this</code> pointer of <code>foo</code>, still in progress, now points to freed memory!</P>

<P>This is something not easily prevented automatically by the compiler.  The issue involved resembles that of the
<A class="code" href="../../class_summary.html#baro">baro</A> class, so an attempt to prevent this issue by
means of compiler tricks like having a temporary intermediate object, would end up doing what a <code>baro</code>
does, and would be a lot of complexity for such a rare possibility.  So, it is better handled at the conceptual level,
to eliminate the problem.</P>

<H3 id="current_semantics">Current Semantics</H3>

<P>Instead of spitting off additional clones each time a <code>cow</code> is dereferenced, the object is only
cloned the <i>first</i> time it is dereferenced.</P>

<P>This is understood as the natural consequence of making a cow handle behave just like a simple value-based
object, only avoiding copying when it doesn&rsquo;t need to.</P>

<OL class="boxed">
	<LI>When a <code>cow</code> is given a value (construction or assignment), it points to the same object as the
	right-hand-side, and is put in a <I>pending</I> state.
	<LI><P>In the <I>pending</I> state, when (and only if!) the cow is dereferenced with <code>operator-></code> or <code>data</code>,

	does not re-check to see if it is still unique.

</DIV>

<P>This will behave just like pure value semantics, except for one subtlety that will be explained later.</P>

</PRE></DIV>
<P>Working strictly with values, as in the listing to the left, <span class="capref">Listing 2A,</span>
it is obvious exactly <I>where</I> a copy is made, and if all the operations are
on a single thread, it is equally clear <I>when</I> relative to other operations.  So it is obvious that <code>result</code>
will obtain <code>1</code>, since that&rsquo;s what it was when <code>two</code> copied it from <code>one</code>,
because that&rsquo;s what it was when <code>one</code> copied it from <code>original</code>.  Setting a new
value in <code>original</code>, well after it was used to initialize <code>one</code>, is irrelevent.</P>

<P>Working with cow handles, as on the right, <span class="capref">Listing 2B,</span>
how does it work?  Presumably no copy is made for <code>one</code> because
it ends up not being used<A HREF="#footnote_2" class="footnoter" target="footer">2</A>.
But what about <code>two</code>?  The
value does not get duplicated until <I>after</I> the original has changed.  Yet we still get the same result!</P>

<P>After all three <code>cow</code> handles are created, all three are pointing to the same single <code>C</code> instance, and all three
are in the <I>pending</I> state.  The handle <code>two</code> is not remembering that it came from <code>one</code>,
but rather all three are peers, sharing in the ownership (owned reference count is 3) of a single instance of <code>C</code>.</P>

<P>When a member function is called through <code>two</code> (via <code>operator-></code>), it makes a copy of
the original object.  The original object drops its owned reference count to 2, and the <code>orignal</code> handle is
the sole owner of the fresh clone.  It is this newly-created copy that is passed to <code>set_x</code>.  So, both
<code>two</code> and <code>one</code> are unaffected.</P>

<P>When <code>two->get_x()</code> is called, the same thing happens.  It makes a copy, another copy of the
original object, and then calls <code>get_x()</code> on that.  So it still returns <code>1</code>, as expected.
Even if we went out of our way to avoid making a copy to call a meer accessor, by writing <code>two->const_object()->get_x()</code>
instead, it would still return <code>1</code> because the still-shared instance of <code>C</code> was never
affected by the call to <code>set_x</code>.</P>

<P>To summarize, <EM>a <code>cow</code> initialized (or assigned) from another that&rsquo;s still in the <I>pending</I>
state is unaffected by subsequent commitment of the original.</EM>  It will work just like pure value copies, with the value being
&ldquo;sensed&rdquo; at the time the assignment is made, not when it is actually performed due to delayed copying.</P>

<P>Here is another example which illustrates the same concept.</P>

<DIV class="left">
<H4 class="caption">Listing 3A</H4>
<PRE class="code" lang="x-Cpp" title="Listing 3A">
C original (1);
C one= original;
original.set_x(2);
C two= one;

int result1= one.get_x();
   <I>// still sees 1</I>
int result2= two.get_x();
   <I>// still sees 1</I>
</PRE></DIV>
<DIV class="right">
<H4 class="caption">Listing 3B</H4>
<PRE class="code" lang="x-Cpp" title="Listing 3B">
cow&lt;C> original (new C(1));
cow&lt;C> one= original;
original->set_x(2);
cow&lt;C> two= one;

int result1= one->get_x();
   <I>// still sees 1</I>
int result2= two->get_x();
   <I>// still sees 1</I>
</PRE></DIV>
<P>Again, the pure value-based code on the left <span class="capref">(Listing 3A)</span>
is obvious.  The variable <code>one</code> is made before
the <code>original</code> is changed, and the variable <code>two</code> is made after the <code>original</code>
is changed.  But, changing <code>orignal</code> has no effect on <code>one</code>, so it doesn&rsquo;t mean
anything when <code>two</code> is initialized.</P>

<P>With the <code>cow</code> handles, the result is again the same.  When <code>set_x</code> is called,
the two handles are separated.  The change to <code>original</code> does not affect the value in <code>one</code>.</P>

<P style="clear:both">Now look at another example, where the right-hand-side is no longer in the <I>pending</I> state.</P>

<DIV class="left">
<H4 class="caption">Listing 4A</H4>
<PRE class="code" lang="x-Cpp" title="Listing 4A">
C original (1);
original.set_x(2);
C one= original;
C two= original;
orignal.set_x(3);
int result1= one.get_x(); <I>// gets <B>2</B></I>
original.set_x(4);
int result2= two.get_x(); <I>// gets 4</I>
result1= one.get_x();  <I>// still 2</I>
</PRE></DIV>
<DIV class="right">
<H4 class="caption">Listing 4B</H4>
<PRE class="code" lang="x-Cpp" title="Listing 4B">
cow&lt;C> original (new C(1));
original->set_x(2); <I>// no longer pending</I>
cow&lt;C> one= original;
cow&lt;C> two= original;
orignal->set_x(3);
int result1= one->get_x(); <I>// gets <B style="color:#D00">3</B></I>
original->set_x(4);
int result2= two->get_x(); <I>// gets 4</I>
result1= one->get_x();  <I>// still 3</I>
</PRE></DIV>

<P>Now, the results are different using delayed copies then they were using pure value semantics.</P>

<P><EM>If a <code>cow</code> is made from an original that is in the <I>performed</I> state, then additional changes
made to the original are seen by the copy, as long as the copy is still <I>pending</I></EM>.  When the copy is
<I>performed</I>, it clones the <U>current</U> value from the original.</P>

<P style="clear:both">The semantics of <code>cow</code> handles are not exactly like the semantics of ordinary values.
However, it is simple and understandable, and it is guaranteed not to cause deadlocks, and it will never destroy an
object that&rsquo;s in the middle of a member function call, will never destroy an object that it&rsquo;s given out
the raw pointer to, and is very efficient.</P>

<!-- link up 'lock' after function reference is ready
   Use a regular handle with it as a changing exemplar -->
<P>There are situations where the subtlety of pending vs. performed states will simply not matter.  To guarantee
scenareos work as you planned, you can <code>lock</code> a <code>cow</code> handle (see examples
for the <code>lock</code> function).  Sometimes, this
is exactly what you want and will be counting on it.  Understanding the state model then becomes essential.  If these
operations are spread over multiple threads, then exactly when a copy is made, relative to operations being done on
other threads, is flexible anyway.</P>
