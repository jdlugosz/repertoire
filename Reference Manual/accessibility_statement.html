<H1>Accessibility Statement</H1>

<!-- Credit to <a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/accessibility_statement.html">Accessibility statement for diveintoaccessibility.org</a> for rough template for this section.
The author, Mark Pilgrim writes, "Feel free to use either of these as a template, including structure, wording, and links to further reading."

<H2 id="accesskeys">Access Keys</H2>

<p>Most browsers support jumping to specific links by typing keys defined on the web site.
On Windows, you can press <kbd>ALT</kbd> + an access key; on Macintosh, you can press <kbd>Control</kbd> + an access key.</p>

<p>All pages in this document define the following access keys:</p>

<ul>
<li>Access key 1 - Main entry point to the book</li>
<li>Access key 2 - Skip to main content</li>
<li>Access key 3 - Table of Contents in this document</li>
<li>Access key 4 - Table of Related Documents in this document</li>
<li>Access key 5 - Parent document in a set, if applicable</li>
<li>Access key 9 - Feedback</li>
<li>Access key 0 - Accessibility statement</li>
</ul>

<H2>Standards Compliance</H2>
<P>These files are written using HTML 4.01.  HTML 4.01 Transitional is used, rather than XHTML, because that is what I started with and
XHTML is harder to code by hand.  I&rsquo;ve not found any reason to change.  HTML doesn&rsquo;t have to mean horrible non-conforming code.
Having some end tags optional, for example, is part of a formal specification, and the pages are validated against that specification.</P>

<P><img STYLE="border-style:none;float:left;margin-right:0.8em" src="http://www.w3.org/Icons/valid-html401"
 alt='"Valid HTML 4.01!" logo' height="31" width="88">
Each page contains a HTML 4.01 validation logo in the footer.  Clicking on the logo will revalidate the page using the W3C&rsquo;s <A HREF="http://validator.w3.org/">Markup Validation Service</A>.
If Javascript is disabled or the page is being served locally, it will go to the Validation Service main page but not automatically enter the URL to be checked.
</P>
<P><img style="border:0;width:88px;height:31px;float:left;margin-right:0.8em" src="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss" alt='"Valid CSS!" logo'>
Likewise, the CSS files are validated using the W3C <A HREF="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">CSS Validation Service</A>.  These
links will re-validate <A class="code" HREF="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=http://www.dlugosz.com/Repertoire/refman/info.css" title="check style sheet for validity">info.css</A>
and <A class="code" HREF="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=http://www.dlugosz.com/Repertoire/refman/index.css" title="check style sheet for validity">index.css</A>.

<H2 id="navlink">Navigation Aids</H2>
<P>Browsers support navigational links that are coded in the page&rsquo;s header via <code>&lt;LINK REL= &hellip;></code> statements.  In addition
to the visible hyperlinks in the document presentation, these provide standard hooks for shortcut keys, assistive technologies, text-only browsers, and browser user interface widgets.</P>

<P>In the Firefox browser, you can use the <A HREF="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2933">Link Widgets</A> or <A HREF="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1324/">cmSiteNavigation Toolbar</A>
to make direct use of these.  Note that they don&rsquo;t show up if the page is in a frame.  Firefox only uses these links if the page is loaded as the top-level document
in the window.</P>

<P>See <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html#type-links">&sect;6.12 Link types</A> in the HTML 4.01 Specification.</P>

<DL class="members spaceafter">
<dt class="code">Start</dt>
<dd>Points to the main frameset.</dd>

<dt><code>Next</code>, <code>Prev</code></dt>
<dd>Generally not used, as the documents are not linear.</dd>

<dt class="code">Contents</dt>

<dt class="code">Index</dt>

about the project itself.</dd>

<dt class="code">Help</dt>

<dt class="code">Bookmark</dt>
<dd>Makes accessible any links that are not obvious otherwise.</dd>

<dt class="code">Up</dt>
<dd>Not listed in the HTML Specification, but is used by the Firefox navigation buttons.
If a document is further divided into sections in separate files, will point back to the parent document.
</DL>

<H2>Links</H2>
<P>Links are typically written to make sence out of context.  I eschew link text like &ldquo;click here&rdquo;.  Usually a link will be the name of the thing being cross-referenced,
as naturally mentioned in the text.  If the meaning of a link is not clear from the text enclosed in the <code>A</code> tags, then a <code>TITLE</code> attribute will be used.</P>

<H2>Images</H2>
<P>All images include descriptive <code>ALT</code> attributes.</P>

<H2>CSS 2.1 for Presentation</H2>
<P>These pages use cascading stype sheets, and avoid mixing content with presentation.  The text is marked up using proper semantic HTML tags, such as <code>UL</code>
for a list, with CSS then used to make it pretty.</P>

<P>The document will be readable with CSS disabled.</P>

<H2>Visual Layout</H2>
<P>No absolute font sizes or column widths are used!  Layout of text is fully &ldquo;liquid&rdquo; and will flow to fit your window size and
your text size.</P>

<P>Frames are used to provide navigation panes around a content window.  If frames are not available, or only one frame is (easily) used at a time, the document
can be navigated through its own hyperlinks, &ldquo;See Also&rdquo; statements throughout the document, a &ldquo;Related Documents&rdquo; section at the top of
each page, <A HREF="#navlink">Navigation Links</A> and <A HREF="#accesskeys">Access Keys</A>, and links back to the <A HREF="class_summary.html">Class Summary</A>
and document <A HREF="http://www.dlugosz.com/Repertoire/refman/mainframe.html" TARGET="_top">main page</A>.


<H1>Principles and HTML Coding Features</H1>

<H2>Technology</H2>

<P>The earliest design principle adopted was to make the entire documentation set downloadable and browsable locally.  That means it cannot be
generated dynamically by code on the server, but must exist as a set of static HTML documents.</P>

<P>Client-side scripting was originally not used at all, and as much functionality was provided as was practical.  Then, Javascript was added to
enhance the usability and ease of development.  Javascript is not required to read this.  It meerly enhances it.  Specifically,</P>
<UL>
	<LI>Having a common page footer included into all pages.  Javascript fills in the text stating the page&rsquo;s own URL, and makes the
	validation logo into a button that re-validates this specific page.
	<LI>In order to make it easy to bookmark a single content page (or post a simple URL, or double-click a file locally), while still providing the frameset
	for navigation, Javascript is used to open the other frames if one page is loaded in isolation.
	<LI>Having done so, Javascript is also used to generate a link at the top of the page to undo it, and show the page alone without frames.
