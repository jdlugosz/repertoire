<H2>Changes since release PB7</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><code>prothonotary</code> includes AppID.
	<LI>June 2006.
    Bug found in smart pointers!  A race condition when the last <code>handle</code> and the last <code>baro</code>
    were destructed at the same time on different threads, never showed up before.
	<LI><code>fixed_memory_pool</code> speeded up again.
	<LI>Vararray improvements.
	<LI>Thunks (closures, <code>member_callback_thunk</code> fully generalized to work with
	multiple and virtual inheritence.
	<LI>October 2004.
    Although it has never caused an actual problem, I detected an issue with freeing the <code>~static_fixed_memory_pool</code>.
    Items from the pool will still be in use, since the shutdown order is not known!  Specifically, the pool for the lifetime object
    is destroyed during DLL shutdown before the static empty string object which uses a lifetime object from the pool.
    Changed to free pool itself after all nodes are returned (so it still stays clear of memory leak reporting tools), and also
    reset the members to zeros so it will spring back to life again if an <code>alloc</code> is made later.

	<LI>Support /CLR option for linking with "Managed" code.

    <LI>Loads of stuff to be cataloged...
</UL>

<H2>Changes since release PB6</H2>
<UL>
	<LI>added <code>directory_list</code> class.
	<LI>Fix: <code>win_exception</code> class broke due to change in ustring.  char* no longer copyed, so format_message
	   helper was returning a pointer to a local buffer.
	 <LI><code>exception::iterator</code> detects error on unballanced delimiter.
	 <LI>Fix: <code>file_factory</code> remove conflict with Windows.h.
	 <LI>added more flags to <code>file_factory</code>.
	 <LI>changed <code>PC_filesystem_t::exists()</code> to use <code>directory_list</code> instead of its own code to do the same thing.
	 <LI>improved <code>PC_filesystem_t::move_file</code> to take flags
	 <LI>Fix: <code>PC_filesystem_t::move_file_delayed</code> on Win9x was using short-name for destination; changed to
	    use short-name for path but name as specified for the final part of the name.  Win9X needs short name paths here.  So
	    why does it tolerate a fullname for the final part?  Could still be issues here.
	 <LI>added "copy defered" and "exists" tests to filename_t_UT.cxx.
	 <LI>added <code>get_nodelist</code> and <code>check_address</code> debugging function to <code>static_fixed_memory_pool</code>.
	 <LI>added more troubleshooting to handle_UT.cxx (never found anything wrong, though).
	 <LI>Fix: MFC CString clone had datalength one place where it meant alloclength.
	 <LI>added classics class <code>mutex</code>.
	 <LI>class <code>can_handle</code>: added destructor to zero out Lifetime pointer, to trap errors earlier.
	 <LI>Fix: smart pointer system could mess up in some circular reference cases.  If deleting the last owner removed the last borrower
	    during its constructor, it would access the lifetime object after it was destroyed.
	 <LI>added much more to <code>profile_timer</code>.  Added wall-clock value, copying, and ability to monitor different threads.
	 <LI>Fix: <code>registry_key::key_exists</code> had mixed up two handles, and didn't work.
	 <LI><code>ustring</code> copy constructor and assignment added, by popular demand.
	 <LI>the exact way the common shared "empty" instance of vararray<T> is handled was changed.  The compiler was found to not
	    correctly deal with static data items inside template functions: the variable itself was right, but the first-time-only constructor
	    lock was not!  So it would cause multiple constructions.  This was harmless in this case, but would leak that object.
	 <LI>Added <code>obj_reference</code> class to <code>server_lifetime_manager_t</code>.
	 <LI>Added ratwin_static.h.
	 <LI>Added ratwin\macrocloak.perl, a technology to deal with WINDOWS.H macros.
	 <LI>Added ratwin\NumOrName.h, a way to handle Win32 API function parameters that take strings, numbers, or enums.
	 <LI>Added ratwin\INI_file.h, ratwin\LZexpand.h, ratwin\mailslot.h, ratwin\MessageBox.h, ratwin\shell.h, ratwin\sysinfo.h,
	    ratwin\window=struct.h, ratwin\io\file=struct.h, ratwin\io\filemapping=struct.h
	 <LI>Added ratwin\COM\BSTR=static.cpp, ratwin\COM\GUID=static.cpp, ratwin\COM\memory=static.cpp
	    ratwin\COM\IEnumSTATSTG.h
	 <LI>Added <code>auto_COM_ptr::operator void*()</code>.
	 <LI>To make the smart pointer system more fault-tolerant against stray pointer bugs, hid the pointer in <code>can_handle</code> and
	 added a diagnostic to <code>get_lifetime_object()</code> (which is no longer inline).
	 <LI>Added some HANDLE subtypes to <code>ratwin::types</code>, and introduced a mechanism so that functions can take a strictly-typed
	 sub-HANDLE, or a plain HANDLE, but not the <I>wrong</I> sub-HANDLE.
	 <LI>moved BitBlt from ratwin\bitmap.h to ratwin\gdi.h
	 <LI>Introduced RATWIN_NoGlobals preprocessor switch.
	 <LI>added ratwin\color=struct.h.
	 <LI>Introduced COLORREF type.
	 <LI>Introduced ChildOrHMENU.h, for CreateWindow parameters.
	 <LI>Added ratwin\controls\ImageList.h, Rebar.h, ToolBar.h
	 <LI>Introduced classics\closure.h
	 <LI>Introduce sMSG form of calls in ratwin, as an alternative to (window,message,wparam,lparam) tuples.
	 <LI>Change ratwin::window_class into a template for CharT.
	 <LI>Tomahawk Lives!  Renamed old directory and started a fresh one, for new development.
	 <LI>Introduced "Release Tools\test_include.perl", to verify interoperability between Ratwin and WINDOWS.H
</UL>

<H2>Changes since release PB5</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><code>exception</code> class uniformly uses <code>ustring</code> instead of pointers.
	<LI>added "setup hook" to <code>exception</code>
	<LI>add <code>string::operator+=</code> for pointers (more efficient than converting pointer to <code>string</code> implicitly)
	<LI>made <code>ustring</code> much more efficient for <code>char*</code> and <code>wchar_t*</code>.  This is a little messy, but is a
	prelude to the next generation <code>ustring</code> class.  This was necessary to restore the level of performance
	lost by making the <code>exception</code> class take <code>ustring</code>s, and the trend toward <code>ustrings</code> everywhere without
	worrying about when raw pointers could be available.
	<LI>introduced classics\utf-8 module.
	<LI>Fix: classics::COM::factory had circular dependancy on RatWin.
	<LI>Fix: classics::COM::server_lifetime_manager now doesn't force a minimum up time.
	<LI>Fix: classics::exception::show_function wasn't exported from the DLL.
	<LI>Fix: file_factory::Create works around a bug in Win9x, where CreateFile returns a 0 handle
	on error instead of INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE, as documented.
	<LI>add zero-argument constructor to classics::filename_t.
	<LI>add members move_file_delayed, get_short_name to classics::PC_filesystem_t,
	and timestamp to filename_t and base filesystem_t.
	<LI>filename_t wrappers around filesystem_t features use const_object on the smart pointer
	rather than the normal defreference, to prevent unneeded copy-on-write.
	<LI>introduced classics::mutex.
	<LI>add members to classics::registry_key : zero-argument constructor, assignment operator,
	value_exists, set_value taking an int, get_value, get_value_string, get_value_int.
	<LI>improve error text for registry_key::create.
	<LI>Fix: bug in classics::UCS2_to_UTF8, bad return code could corrupt the stack.
	<LI>introduced "virtual key" features in classics::VK::*.  Header classics\virtual_key.h
</UL>

<H2>Changes since release PB4</H2>
<UL>
	<LI>Fix: <code>exception</code>'s <code>default_show_function</code> incorrectly contained a <code>static</code> modifier for a local variable.
	   This caused problems when additional named items were present in exceptions to be displayed.
	<LI>Fix: <code>win_exception</code> didn't format error string under Win95
	<LI>Fix: atomic_counter.h needed <code>Xexchange</code> for <code>byte</code> and <code>char</code>.
	<LI>Fix: <code>atomic_counter</code> of one byte had <code>add</code> instead of <code>xadd</code> instruction.
	   It seemed to work just fine anyway...
	<LI>string class constructors detect a <code>NULL</code> <code>char*</code>/<code>wchar_t*</code> pointer as an empty string.
	   Specifically, it won't call <code>strlen</code>/<code>wcslen</code> on a <code>NULL</code> pointer.
	<LI>Update <code>filename_t</code> class to automatically handle ANSI or Unicode
	<LI>Introduce "classics\new.h" feature.
	<LI>Introduce <code>PC_filesystem_t::move_file</code> function.
	<LI>COM-related classes introduced: <code>factory</code>, <code>prothonotary</code>, and <code>server_lifetime_manager</code>.
	<LI>Introduce <code>registry_key</code> class.
	<LI>Introduce 32-bit CRC functions.
	<LI>Simple <code>file_factory</code> class taken from Tomahawk.
