<H1>thread safety semantic classification</H1>

<P>Leading <B>I</B> - description applies per-instance.</P>
<P>Leading <B>C</B> - description applies across all instances of the class</P>
<P><B>OTO</B> - One Thread Only.  The thread that owns the object is the only one that may use it.</P>
<P><B>OTT</B> - One Thread At A Time.  Any thread may use the object, but only one at a time.  Use
	some kind of mutual exclusion mechanism to allow multiple threads to safely access the same object.</P>
<P><B>GRP</B> - Group.  It's complex, in that different groups of members have different access rules, and
	context dictates whether some particular useage is allowed when other threads are already using the object.</P>
<P><B>R/W</B> - Reader/Writer.  A special (and common) case of GRP.  One writer may access the object,
	or multiple readers may access the object.</P>
<P><B>FT</B> - Free Threaded.  Anything goes.</P>
