<H2>Introduction to General Purpose Libraries</H2>

<P>Reuse is good.  Reusable code is nice because we can use something again 
without building a new one.  It's also nice when one part can be used several 
times in the same program, since that keeps the program's size down and also 
makes it more maintainable.</P>

<P>But reuse of code goes beyond simple convenience.  If a component was written 
to be reusable, it may be very well designed and carefully crafted.  All the 
little details will be taken care of, and upon reuse you just don't have to 
worry about it anymore.</P>

<P>Consider a simple case of reusing a function:
When creating a window, how many people just use a stock 
white brush for the background?  The robust behavior is to look up the 
control panel settings for what window backgrounds ought to be.  A small 
detail, but a function such as <code>CreateWindow</code> that has a zillion parameters has 
a lot of small details.</P>

<P>A reusable part to create a program's main window is a very simple part: a 
single function, perhaps half a page in length.  However, by building such a 
part you put a great deal of attention into details that you might omit if 
you were just coding yet another call to <code>CreateWindow</code> in some program.
The work pays off, because once built, you can get better functionality, in 
addition to being easier to use than writing yet another call to <code>CreateWindow</code>.</P>

<H2>John's Principles of Library Design</H2>

<P>So just what is a "class library", anyway?  I've seen libraries that try to 
make C++ look like SmallTalk.  I've seen specialized libraries for various 
purposes.  But, for the most part, the "general purpose" libraries I've seen 
are actually programming religions.  That is, to use the library, you have to 
adopt the library's way of doing things, throughout the entire program.  It's 
like kudzu:  once planted, it gets into everything.  Microsoft's MFC is an example of this kind of system.</P>

<P>My feelings are somewhat different.  A library should provide components that 
are useful in places such that you want to use it, as opposed to requiring 
the entire program to be written a certain way just so you can get some 
feature.</P>

<P>That is, <B>the use of a library component in one place should not 
have an undue influence on how the program is written in other places.</B></P>

<P>Second, <B>the library should be useful as separate parts, and the use of one 
simple part should not drag in the entire beast.</B>  This can be paradoxical, 
since if components are generally useful why can't you use then when writing 
other components in the library?  This issue is thorny, and will be covered 
again in more detail.</P>

Third, <B>reusable code should be general and extensible.</B>
A good library needs to embody a compromise between being too flexible and 
being inflexible.</P>


<A NAME="whyuse"><H2>Why Use This Stuff?</H2></A>

<P>With so many C++ libraries out there, including stuff that comes with the compiler,
why look into another one?  It boils down to two compelling reasons:  <B>features</B>
and <B>robustness</B>.</P>

<P>Some of the things in the Classics library are new, in the sence of not seeing them
in other libraries.  For example, the 
<A HREF="class_summary.html#ustring">ustring</A>
class is a new concept, the 
<A HREF="Classics/Smart%20Pointers%20Overview.html#toptop">smart pointers</A>
are more technically advanced than others, the multi-stanza 
<A HREF="class_summary.html#exception">exception</A>
objects provide
superior error reporting, and the 
<A HREF="class_summary.html#vararray">vararray</A>
collection offers handy
copy-on-write features not found in traditional implementations.</P>

<P>Robustness is of primary importance if you are trying to write solid code yourself.
Not a week goes by that I don't hear about Microsoft's STL implementation messing
up in some way, or bugs in MFC, or Win32 primitives that are poorly documented or
don't handle boundary conditions very well.</P>

<P>What might seem like a "thin" wrapper in Classics is often the necessary code
to make a Win32 primitive robust.  That is, it handles boundary conditions and
checks for errors.  Na&iuml;ve code that simply calls functions like <code>MultiByteToWideChar</code>
as shown in the numerous example programs and magazine articles will not be as
robust as using Classics, because these functions often have subtle and surprising
caveats.</P>

<P>The vararray class will work properly (unlike STL vectors) without bizzare failures at
boundary conditions and some choices of template arguments.
The string class will operate correctly 
(<A HREF="Classics/ustring.html#CString_notes">unlike MFC's CString</A>) even when multiple threads
are being used.  Count on it.  If I'm ever in a hospital, I'll take comfort in knowing
that the medical imaging equitment uses Classics rather than MFC.  Microsoft Word
might lose work from time to time and users put up with it.  But don't pull that stunt
with a patient's brain scan!</P>

<H2>Robustness</H2>

<P>A reusable component should work <B>correctly</B> and <B>reliably</B> before
you ever consider building anything with that component.</P>

<P>The Repertoire Project sets itself apart from other libraries because it's built like
a tank.  Furthermore, the code is extensivly tested, and the testing code is
shipped along with the actual library, making it eay for you add new test cases if
you suspect something, and to do full regression testing any time a change is made.</P>

<P>See <A HREF="robustness.html#toptop">Robust Code and Testing</A>
for more on robustness and testing issues.</P>

<P>Furthermore, thread-safety is designed into the code from the inception.
This can be important when actually using the code in a multi-threaded
environment.  Other libraries (such as MFC's <A HREF="Classics/ustring.html#CString_notes">CString</A> class) is full of
race conditions, or worse yet, casual use of locking that leads to potential
deadlocks.</P>


<HR>
<A NAME="Classics"><H2>Classics</H2>

<P><I>ClassICs</I> is a library of general purpose C++ components.  This is actually 
the third major redesign of the library, so it ought to be called Classics 3.
However, it was never widely distributed&mdash;it was just a (less than 
successful) attempt to gather my own useful objects together into a common 
place, and document them.</P>

<P>The name Classics has a double meaning.  "Class ICs" brings to mind reusable
components, such as electronic ICs.  One meaning of <I>classic</I> is <I>in accordance
with established principles of excellence in the arts and sciences.</I>  Another is
<I>balanced, formal, objective, austere, regular, simple, etc.</I></P>

<P>In short, it perfectly describes the design principles embodied in this
library, that of high quality, robustness, and simple elegance.</P>

<HR>
<A NAME="RatWin"><H2>RatWin</H2></A>

RatWin stands for <I>Rationalized Windows</I>, and is a set of C++ header files
as an alternative to the traditional WINDOWS.H file.  They feature strong type
checking, overloading, namespaces, and no macros.</P>

<HR>
<A NAME="Tomahawk"><H2>Tomahawk</H2></A>

Tomahawk is an experimental Windows programming framework.  It's still in
the experimental stages.</P>

<HR>
<A NAME="Conquer"><H2>Conquer</H2></A>

Conquer will be a library for multi-threaded programming.  It is still in the
planning stages.</P>
