<H1>Problems with Internet Explorer Rendering</H1>
<P>Here are some of the problems I see with using Microsoft&rsquo;s Internet Explorer.</P>
<OL>
	<LI>Borders appear around IFRAMEs, used to include common content into multiple files.  The CSS says <code>border:none</code>, but IE won&rsquo;t take no for an answer.
	<LI>Scroll bars appear around IFRAMEs, probably because it computes sizes of boxes wrong.  Something about adding the padding size instead of subtracting it...
	<LI>Prior to IE7, fonts were always one size larger than specified.
	<LI>Sometimes image transparancy doesn&rsquo;t work right, giving the wrong color.
	<LI>Links don&rsquo;t show the underline when mouse hovers.
</OL>
<H2>Still in IE7</H2>
<OL>
	<LI>Border appears around IFRAMEs
	<LI>When <I>correctly</I> nesting a list as an item of another list, it shows a blank line before the first subitem.
