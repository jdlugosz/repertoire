<H2 id="overview">Overview</H2>

<H3> Etymology</H3>
<P>The Old English words for <I>window</I> were <I>eagþyrl</I>, which literally means "eye-hole," and <I>eagduru</I>, "eye-door."
The former has a better meaning for windows that are used to view through, as opposed to those that
let air in.  But, I didn't want to worry about having to type the "þ" (thorn) character, which is no longer in the English alphabet
and not in ASCII.</P>

<P><IMG src="../images/oneway-sign-50U.png" ALIGN="right" ALT="One Way road sign" TITLE="This icon indicates that you must create objects in the proscribed manner">
All instances of concrete types derived from <code>message_tap</code>, which is a base class of <code>eagduru</code>, <em>must use
<code>new</code> to create instances</em>.  The code within the class uses smart pointers
and will <code>delete</code> this object when the reference count drops to zero.  So, you must
not create an instance on the stack or in static data.</P>
<P>Instances cannot be assigned or copied.</P>
<P>Instances use smart pointers to control their lifetime.  As you would expect, the object is destroyed when the
last smart pointer holding it is dropped.  However, the Windows primitive <code>HWND</code> window also participates in the ownership
of this object.  Effectively (though the actual implementation is more circuitous), the window contains a smart pointer to
this object.  The interesting ramifications of this are:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>You don’t have to keep a pointer to the object if you don’t otherwise need one.
	<LI>Even if you don’t have any pointers to the object, it will not be destroyed until the
		window is closed.
