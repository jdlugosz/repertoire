<H2 id="message">The <code>WM_TOMAHAWK</code> Message</H2>

<P>Tomahawk defines a Windows message called <code>WM_TOMAHAWK</code>, in keeping with the naming
conventions of such things.  It is general purpose, using a subcode for different meanings.  Anything the library
needs to do that requires a special message can use this one.</P>

<P>The message identifier is dynamically allocated from Windows, using <code>RegisterWindowMessage ("WM_TOMAHAWK")</code>.
You don’t know what the number is, and it may vary from run to run.  But, it will be the same for the life of the
program, and the same across all programs in the same Window Session.</P>

<P>To obtain the message identifier, use the static memer <code>get_TOMAHAWK_id</code> in
the file <code>Tomahawk\MSG\WM_TOMAHAWK.h</code>.  The full name is seen in the example:</P>

<PRE class="code">
const unsigned <B>WM_TOMAHAWK</B>= ::tomahawk::MSG::WM_TOMAHAWK_msg::<B>get_TOMAHAWK_id</B>();
</PRE>



<H2 id="msg-struct">The <code>WM_TOMAHAWK_msg</code> Structure</H2> 

<P>The <code>WM_TOMAHAWK_msg</code> structure is similar to the <A HREF="message_crack.html#WM_xxx">WM_ ..._msg</A>
structures defined for the normal Windows messages.  However, because the message’s id code is not known
at compile time, there are a couple differences:</P>

<P>The constant member <code>message_constant</code> is defined for consistancy with the other message structures.
However, it is not known at compile time, and is computed at static construction time when the program is loaded.
Because the order of initialization of the DLLs making up a program is undefined, you should not count on Tomahawk’s
static constructors to be called already when executing the code belonging to a static constructor in a DLL.  (In the
main EXE code, you know all DLLs have been initialized first.)</P>

<P>The function <code>get_TOMAHAWK_id</code> will always work, though.</P>

<P>The other difference you may notice is that using the <code>WM_TOMAHAWK</code> struct will incur a dependancy on
the Tomahawk DLL, while none of the other <code>WM_..._msg</code> structs do since they are entirely inline.  However,
if you are using the <code>WM_TOMAHAWK</code> message you are probably using other features of the library anyway.</P>


<H2 id="subcodes">Subcodes</H2>

<P>Only one subcode is defined so far.</P>

<H3 id="pre_translate_message">The <code>pre_translate_message</code> subcode</H3>

<P>The pre-translate message is part of a convention that allows windows to define their own
pre-translation step.  Instead of a message pump needing to know about the windows
it is servicing and call <code>IsDialog</code> for every dialog box and <code>TranslateAccelerator</code> for top-level windows
that use accelerator tables, this message is used so that the message routing system can let the
window define its own work, in the same way as any other message is handled by windows.</P>

<P>The proper use can be seen in the <A HREF="simple_message_pump.html#pre_translate_message" class="code">simple_message_pump::pre_translate</A> function.
The other end&mdash;code that receives the message and does any pre-translation&mdash;can be
seen in the <A HREF="message_tap.html#pre_translate_message" class="code">message_tap::pre_translate_message</A>
function.</P>
