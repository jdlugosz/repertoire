<H2 id="overview">Overview</H2>
<P>The Win32 GUI API, like the 16-bit Windows before it, calls the WinProc with 4 parameters.  It uses the
same four parameters for any type of message, and the relevant information is packed, sometimes quite
creatively, into those values.</P>

<P>Many years ago there was a header file in the Windows SDK called <code>WINDOWSX.H</code> that
had macros called &ldquo;message crackers&rdquo;.  Before Wizard-driven frameworks became popular,
this was very popular among writers who would teach Windows programming.</P>

<P>In the Repertoire library, the central idea is to make code that is truely reusable on the binary level,
not wizards that generate stock code.  The mechanism in Tomahawk for building message handlers
uses a virtual function to handle whole groups of messages, as opposed to one virtual function for
every possible message.  The plumbing of the message router is exposed, at least a little bit, to the user.
So, breaking the raw message parameters up into something useful and appropreate to the message
can’t be hidden away somewhere.</P>

<P>To this end, I wanted something like the old Message Crackers.  Only, do so without macros, and with
as much type-safety as practical.</P>

<P>The resulting system is centered around the <A HREF="#MSG_cast">Message Cast</A> mechanism.</P>


<H2 id="sMSG">The <code>sMSG</code> structure</H2>

<P>The <code>sMSG</code> structure, defined in <code>Ratwin\message=struct.h</code>,
contains the data that is passed to the WinProc functions.  The fields are named <code>hwnd</code>,
<code>message</code>, <code>wParam</code>, and <code>lParam</code>.</P>

<P>This is designed to have the same layout on the stack, when passed by value, as the four
invidual parameters normally have in a WinProc.  Specifically, you can define a WinProc to receive
a <code>sMSG</code> and Windows indeed passes you one!</P>

<H3>Why pass a structure?</H3>

<P>There are several motives behind passing a single structure rather than 4 individual parameters.
Originally, it tied in with the concept behind the thunk class which, at the time, only handled one parameter.
This is really all that is needed, because multiple parameters can always be combined into a single structure.
This is no longer an issue because there is now a distinct template for closures with each number of arguments.
However, what started out as a limitation/work-around turned into an inspiration.  It was better as a structure
than it ever was as four loose arguments!</P>

<P>It makes sence to combine the parameters that are always passed as a group.  It makes
engineering sence that these ought to be grouped together into one named entity, and it is more efficient
to pass the whole structure (by reference) to deeper functions rather than re-pushing the same parameters
over and over.  The code handling messages will often contain only a little code and then call another function
with the same message data, and call the base class version, and call the default, etc.  The message is
<I>routed</I> to modular code, so it gets passed a lot and treated as a lump.</P>

<P>Finally, putting the items together makes the idea of the <A HREF="#MSG_cast" class="code">MSG_cast</A>
very clean and elegant.  In comparison, it would be awkward to deal with loose parameters.</P>

<H3>Why is it so plain?</H3>

<P>I’ve seen a structure that uses unions to allow easy addressing of the individual words and bytes
of the lParam and wParam, and provide meaningful names for the commonly-used fields, all together
in one structure and referring to the same bytes.  This kind of system was part of the inspiration,
but in C++ we can do much better than we could in C, and expect a higher degree of type safety.</P>

<P>So, the <code>sMSG</code> structure doesn’t have any of that baggage in it.  It’s just the 4 parameters
with no special way to &ldquo;crack&rdquo; them or refer to them with more meaningful names.
Instead, each set of cracked arguments is described in a <I>different</I> class, with each class
named after the message it services.</P>

<H2 id="WM_xxx">WM_..._msg structures</H2>

<P>There are structures named after the messages they service, one per file, in the <code>Tomahawk\MSG</code>
directory.  For example, <code>WM_command_msg</code> is a struct in <code>Tomahawk\MSG\WM_COMMAND.h</code>,
and <code>WM_MOUSEMOVE_msg</code> is in <code>Tomahawk\MSG\WM_MOUSEMOVE.h</code>.</P>

<P>Each struct defines appropriate data members instead of <code>wParam</code> and <code>lParam</code>.
For example, <code>WM_MOUSEMOVE_msg</code> contains an <code>unsigned KeyIndicators</code> and
two <code>short</code>s for <code>XPos</code> and <code>YPos</code>.  You don’t have to know
implicitly that the key indicators are in <code>wParam</code>, since it is called <code>KeyIndicators</code> instead.
You don’t have to deal with unpacking the high and low bits from <code>lParam</code> since the struct is
declared in a way to access those bits directly.  Generally, the data member names are those used in some versions of
the Windows SDK documentation of the message.</P>

<P>The data members in the typed message structure are better than knowing how to unpack and extract
the values from the generic <code>sMSG</code>.  We could stop there.  But, Tomahawk goes a step further
and defines inline accessor functions for all the information.</P>

<P>In the <code>WM_MOUSEMOVE_msg</code> struct, the const member function <code>key_indicators()</code>
might seem to be no different than the data member <code>KeyIndicators</code>.  You can in fact use either, since
all the data members are public.  However, notice that the function returns an enumeration for the flags, while the
data member is a simple <code>unsigned</code>.  The data member could not be declared as the enumeration
type because there is no way to specify the actual bit-size and control the layout.  So the data members are
defined using basic integer types only, while the member functions can be defined with stronger typing.  The functions
are more flexible, and there could be multiple ways to refer to the same data, and no need to match the
actual concrete data layout.  In short, the functions provide the kind of abstraction you would normally expect from
software engineering, while the data members match the pre-defined bit layout.</P>

<P>Also, the member functions are given consistant and unambiguous names across all message types.  <code>mouse_position</code>
is clearer than just <code>pos</code>.</P>

<H2 id="MSG_cast">Message Casting</H2>

<P>The specific message structure contains only those things for that message, and exposes them in a normal
enough manner.  The question is, how do you get a specific message structure, when WinProc is passed a
generic <code>sMSG</code>?</P>

<P>All the message structures are exactly the same size, since they all expose the same sized record in
different ways.  So, it should be possible to cast one to another.  Given a pointer to a struct, you can
cast it into a pointer to a different struct.  Given a value (as opposed to a pointer) you can cast it to a reference
to some other struct.  Using old-style C casts, the compiler will take your word for it and never complain.</P>

<P>Here we have a slightly better way.  In C++ the new-style casts are better because each one has a different
purpose, and the compiler can catch some kinds of mistakes.  In Tomahawk there is a <code>MSG_cast</code>
that matches the syntax of the C++ casting operators.  It is more limited than a C-style cast in that the compiler
ensures that <I>only different kinds of message structures are cast to other message structures</I>.</P>

<P>That is, you could code <code>process_Size (MSG_cast&lt;WM_SIZE_msg>(msg));</code> and
the compiler makes two checks:  it checks that <code>process_Size</code> is expecting a <code>WM_SIZE</code> message, and
it also checks that <code>msg</code> is some message structure.  You can’t pass just anything to a message
cast&mdash;it only works between message structures, and this is a compile-time check.</P>

<P>What it doesn’t do is make sure that the <code>msg</code> is in fact a <code>WM_SIZE</code>
message.  Since it is typically used like this:</P>

<H4 class="caption">Listing 1</H4>
<PRE class="code" lang="x-Cpp" title="Listing 1">
 switch (msg.message) {
    case WM_MOUSEMOVE:
       process_MouseMove (<EM>MSG_cast</EM>&lt;WM_MOUSEMOVE_msg>(msg));
       break;
    case WM_SIZE:
       process_Size (<EM>MSG_cast</EM>&lt;WM_SIZE_msg>(msg));
       break;
    }
</PRE>

<P>misusing it is generally not a problem.  However, there’s nothing to stop you from writing</P>
<H4 class="caption">Listing 2</H4>
<PRE class="code" lang="x-Cpp" title="Listing 2">
void C::process_Size (const WM_SIZE_msg&amp; msg)
 {
 assert (msg.message == WM_SIZE);
 <I>// ... get on with the real work.</I>
 }
</PRE>

<P>just to make sure.  Given the tight naming convention between the message name and the struct name,
making the structure define its own id would not be generally helpful for coding.  But, what about templates?
To make it possible to make generic code like:</P>

<H4 class="caption">Listing 3</H4>
<PRE class="code" lang="x-Cpp" title="Listing 3">
template &lt;typename T>
void foo (const T&amp; msg)
 {
 assert (msg.message == <EM>T::message_constant</EM>);
 <I>// ...</I>
 }
</PRE>

<P>The example program <code>message_tap_demo.cxx</code> shows how to use the message
casts for message cracking.  The main handler takes its <code>sMSG</code> and casts it to the proper type, calling the handler function
for that message type.  The handlers declare their parameter of the specific type, and pass by
reference.</P>
