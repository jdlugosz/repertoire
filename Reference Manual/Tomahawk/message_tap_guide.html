<H2 id="overview">Overview</H2>

<P>This class provides a WinProc that adds a <I>this</I> pointer and calls a virtual function on
an object.</P>

<P>Many libraries provide some mechanism for associating a C++ object with a Win32 primitive <code>HWND</code>.
When the WinProc is called for that window, it needs to find the associated C++ object and call the
virtual function on it.  Somehow, there needs to be a way to store that association and the plumbing
code that goes in the &ldquo;real&rdquo; WinProc.</P>

<P>Windows provides a couple such mechanisms, including:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>Reserving extra bytes in the <code>WNDCLASS</code>.  This is the most straightforward, but
	is only applicable when you designed the <code</code>>WNDCLASS for this purpose.  It cannot work
	on subclassed windows or controls.
	<LI>Use the <code>GWL_USERDATA</code>.  But only if no other code is already using it
	<LI>Use the <code>DWL_USER</code> data or other data area as provided by various <code>WNDCLASS</code>’s.  But
	each <code>WNDCLASS</code> has its own way of doing it, so this is not general purpose.
	<LI>Use a named window property.  With a unique name (e.g. a GUID) this should work on
	any window.  That’s what properties are for.  Unfortunatly, it was the slowest mechanism for storing
	data in a Window, when I timed them all.
	<LI>Use an associative array (often called a Map).  This would seem to be pointless since it basically
	does the same work as a Property, and that code is already built-in.  Microsoft’s MFC uses this.  But,
	MFC’s implementation uses a thread-local Map, so the associated object can only be looked up on the
	thread that created the <code>HWND</code>!  This is not a problem with the Map idea, but a limitation in their
	implementation.  A general implementation would essentially duplicate the built-in Property
	mechanism, and is complicated by the need to remove the entry when the <code>HWND</code> is closed.
</UL>

<P>The first experimental version of Tomahawk went to some length to avoid the overhead of a Property,
and so abstracted out the &ldquo;message tap&rdquo; with different concrete implementations for different
situations.  It could always use the Property if there wasn’t a better way, but it could use a faster way
in many common cases.</P>

<P>In this library, though, I use a totally different approach that is faster than any of the above.  Instead of
a WndProc that looks up the object (by whatever means) and calls a function on that object, I use a WndProc
that is hard-coded with the address of the object and calls it directly without having to find anything.</P>

<P>This is possible by using dynamically-generated WndProcs, one per instance.  That is the responsibility of
the <code>member_callback_thunk</code> class.  This <code>message_tap</code> class uses a
<code>member_callback_thunk</code>, and encapsulates the mechanism for subclassing an <code>HWND</code>
and all the related housekeeping issues.</P>

<P>That’s <I>all</I> this class does: take care of the housekeeping of using the thunk as a WndProc.  What it
ends up calling is a simple function called <A HREF="message_tap.html#handle_message" class="code">handle_message</A>.
It does not implement any kind of fancy message dispatching system or other things.  It has amost no policy imposed,
and can be used as a building-block for any kind of message handing system.</P>

<H2 id="threading">Threading Issues</H2>
<P>Most of what this class does is associated with constructor/destructor activity, and as such
does not expect functions to be called more than once, irreguardless of threads.</P>
<P>This class does not use any thread-specific data, so it does not matter which thread
calls a particular member.</P>
<P>The object was not designed to be used by more that one thread simultainiously.  So it is
classified as OTT.</P>


<H2 id="housekeeping">Housekeeping Issues</H2>
<P><IMG src="../images/oneway-sign-50U.png" ALIGN="right" ALT="One Way road sign" TITLE="This icon indicates that you must create objects in the proscribed manner">
All instances of concrete types derived from <code>message_tap</code> <em>must use
<code>new</code> to create instances</em>.  The code within the class uses smart pointers
and will <code>delete</code> this object when the reference count drops to zero.  So, you must
not create an instance on the stack or in static data.</P>
<P>Instances cannot be assigned or copied.</P>
<P>Instances use smart pointers to control their lifetime.  As you would expect, the object is destroyed when the
last smart pointer holding it is dropped.  However, the Windows primitive <code>HWND</code> window also participates in the ownership
of this object.  Effectively (though the actual implementation is more circuitous), the window contains a smart pointer to 
this object.  The interesting ramifications of this are:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>You don’t have to keep a pointer to the object if you don’t otherwise need one.
	<LI>Even if you don’t have any pointers to the object, it will not be destroyed until the
		window is closed.
</UL>

<H2 id="howtouse">How to Use</H2>
<P>The program <code>message_tap_demo.cxx</code> contains a class <code>testhook_1</code>
which shows how to use the <code>message_tap</code>.  The basic steps are:</P>
<OL>
	<LI>derive your class from <code>message_tap</code>.
	<LI>implement the <code>handle_message</code> member function.
	<LI>create the <code>HWND</code> window and instansiate your class.
	<LI>call <code>hook</code>.
</OL>

<H3>Derive Your Class</H3>
<P>The <code>message_tap</code> class is intended to be used as a base class.  Instances of your concrete
class are bound 1:1 to <code>HWND</code> windows.  You supply a virtual function that is called as the WinProc of the window.</P>

<H3>The <code>handle_message</code> Function</H3>
<P>When Windows sends a message to the <code>HWND</code> window, it triggers the 
<A HREF="message_tap.html#handle_message" class="code" TARGET="info">handle_message</A>
virtual function. Write this function in your concrete class to do whatever you want the window to do
in response to various messages.  This example uses the <A HREF="MSG.html#toptop" class="code" TARGET="info">MSG</A>
classes to &ldquo;crack&rdquo; the windows messages.  See that class’s documentation for details.  In this example,
the program handles <code>WM_MOUSEMOVE</code> and <code>WM_SIZE</code>, just for demonstration
purposes.</P>

<H3>Create the <code>HWND</code> and the Instance</H3>
<P>You create the <code>HWND</code> by whatever means (it is not handled by this class), and construct an instance of your
concrete type. These are two distinct steps; they are performed separately.</P>

<PRE class="code">
ratwin::types::HWND <B>hWnd</B>= CreateWindow (WinclassName, "message_tap sample",  WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW|WS_VISIBLE);
testhook_1* <B>p</B>= new testhook_1;
</PRE>

<P>In the InitInstance function of the sample program, the <code>HWND</code> is created using a call to the Win32 primitive
<code>CreateWindow</code>.  The instance is constructed using <code>new</code>, as <A HREF="#housekeeping">it must</A>.</P>

<P>The <code>WinclassName</code> used in the call to <code>CreateWindow</code> is 
<A HREF="#WNDCLASS">discussed later</A>.</P>

<P>The <code>new testhook_1</code> is assigned to a simple pointer, not a smart pointer.  That is fine since this code
is not going to remember the value after InitInstance returns.  The window itself keeps a reference to this object, and
the object will be destructed when the window is closed.  If I had <I>kept</I> a pointer (that is, not a smart pointer), it would point
to an object that the smart pointer system might free, without itself participating in the lifetime control.  In general, don’t
do that.  But construction is a special case.  Here, <code>p</code> is used only before the object is
introduced to the smart pointer system, never used after the call that creates the first smart pointer to the object, and
then goes out of scope.  However, you could have written</P>

<PRE class="code">
classics::handle&lt;testhook_1> h= new testhook_1;
</PRE>

<P>if the situation were more complex.</P>

<H3>Call <code>hook</code></H3>

<P>Once the two items&mdash;the <code>HWND</code> and the class instance&mdash;have been created, the final step is to
put them together.  This is done with the <A HREF="message_tap.html#hook" class="code" TARGET="info">hook</A>
function inherited from the <code>message_tap</code> class.</P>

<PRE class="code">
p->hook (hWnd);  // <I>now Window has (owns) a smart-pointer to it.</I>
</PRE>

<P>Once <code>hook</code> is called, your object starts receiving messages from that window.</P>

<P>Note that <code>InitInstance</code> returns and neither <code>hWnd</code> nor <code>p</code> is
remembered anywhere other than in the local variables that just went out of scope.  There is no need to
keep track of them within the program, since the window keeps track of the object and the window is on the
screen.</P>

<H2 id="WNDCLASS">About the <code>WNDCLASS</code></H2>
<P>As explained in the <A HREF="#overview">Overview</A>, this window-hooking mechanism does not
use a single WinProc shared among all windows that use the system; rather, every window has a unique run-time-generated
WinProc.  So, what WinProc should be used when creating the window?</P>

<P>Since you are going to subclass the window anyway, it really doesn’t matter what WinProc is used to
create it.  Generally, the default DefWinProc in Windows will do just fine.  But, if there <I>is</I> any
message handling going on in the original WinProc, it will still be called when your <code>handle_message</code>
decides not to handle a message and calls the base-class handler.</P>

<P>The actual WinProc used in this program is <code>really_minimal_window_proc</code> found in RatWin.
The only thing is handles is to quit the program when the window is closed; otherwise it just calls DefWinProc.
This is good for a main window, as it’s one less thing to worry about in the program.</P>

<P>Everything is taken from the default constructor of <code>window_class</code>, which is a RatWin class around the
<code>WNDCLASS</code>.</P>
