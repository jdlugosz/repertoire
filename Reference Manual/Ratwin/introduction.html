<A NAME="2"><H2>General Concept</H2></A>

<P>RatWin is a set of <B>Rat</B>ionalized <B>Win</B>dows header files.</P>

<P>In a nutshell, I don't like having a monolithic header file.  It drags in a ridiculous amount of stuff I don't need, 
compiles slowly, and overuses macros.  I've been bitten by macros a time or two.  The "NO" symbols for leaving stuff 
out is silly.  Instead of a page or two of #define's before including &lt;windows.h&gt; to leave stuff out, 
I should say things to bring stuff in.  Furthermore, &lt;windows.h&gt; doesn't always compile if you define a bunch of 
NO symbols!  To top it off, the stuff shows a C heritage which is less than ideal for C++.</P>

<P>My concept is to repackage the include files.  It uses namespaces, so you must explicitly ask for the symbols 
you want.  It uses lots of small header files that are independent of each other, so you can include just 
what you need.  It has strict type checking that makes the &lt;windows.h&gt; <code>STRICT</code> mode look untyped by 
comparison.  And best of all, no macros!  The only use of #define is for the include-file interlock symbol to 
prevent multiple inclusions.</P>

<P><B>The charter is to repackage the existing API, not design a new API.</B>
 So, the function names and other symbol names are unchanged, even though a lot of the prefixes are unnecessary 
thanks to the better scoping being employed.  Some of the functions have overloaded forms, default 
arguments, or missing arguments, use strong types, add const, and change pointers to references.  But there 
are no big semantic changes.</P>

<A NAME="12"><H3>Dependancies with Other Libraries and DLLs</H3></A>

<P>The RatWin headers use some headers from Classics.  However, its use of Classics is compile-time
only.  That is, it may use types and inline functions, from the headers, but cannot use anything
that requires linking with Classics.</P>

<P>Using RatWin will not produce dependancies against any DLL or library other than
the Win32 System DLLs.</P>

<P><I>Note: there seems to be a use of classics::string, which is contrary to this
design requirement and will be eliminated.</I></P>

<P>Most of the features in the RatWin headers are simply types and inline functions to call
Win32 system functions.  So, including the RatWin headers will not necessarily require the
RatWin.DLL file to be linked in as well.</P>

<P>Some features are implemented in compiled code, not entirely in the header, and if such a
feature is used then it becomes necessary to link with RatWin.lib and supply RatWin.dll at run-time.
This DLL is very small (20K).  The RatWin.dll includes:
<UL>
	<LI>Wrappers that were chosen to not be inline, because
	<UL>	<LI>they call non-inline things themselves, so avoiding non-inline code on a matter of principle is no longer a consideration;
			<LI>so many parameters are supplied by the wrapper that the code savings is significant;
			<LI>or there is significant added value so the function is not trivial.
	</UL>
	<LI>The <code>get_instance()</code> function, which caches the result of <code>GetModuleHandle</code>.
	<LI>A built-in minimal WinProc which adds <code>WM_QUIT</code> handling to the <code>DefWinProc</code>.
	<LI>A constructor for <code>window_class</code>, derived from <code>WNDCLASS</code>, which
		populates all the members to useful default values including correct color and cursor.
</UL>


<A NAME="4"><H3>Theory of Implementation</H2></A>

<P>Right now I'm using "cloaked" declarations to import the actual functions.  They are cloaked because at 
least one argument is of a special type that will never actually be used anywhere.  This way you 
will never match it when resolving overloading.  Meanwhile, the C++ style functions call these global 
ones, using typecasts and inline code.  I'll change this as soon as I learn enough about DLL's to devise a 
better way.  In the meantime, I'm sidestepping the limitations of this technique.</P>


<A NAME="5"><H3>Extending RatWin</H2></A>

<P>I don't want to do (possibly automated) large-scale conversions of &lt;windows.h&gt; items.  
Instead, I want to do just what I need, so everything in there has been tested and used in a real situation.  
This applies not only to insuring correct translations, but tests the usability and packaging concepts.  
As it grows, I will certainly alter the organization.</P>

<P>Contributions are welcome.  If you fix things or add more items, use a <code>/*changed*/</code>
 or<code> /*added*/</code> &hellip; <code>/*end added*/</code> 
comment so I can spot it to integrate into the next version.</P>

<A NAME="6"><H2>User's Guide</H2></A>

<A NAME="types"><H3>Types</H3></A>

<A NAME="8"><H4>Fundimental Types (pointers, words, etc.)</H4></A>

<P>In general, normal C++ types are used throughout RatWin.  Instead of hiding a parameter's
type under multiple layers of typedefs and macros, the actual C++ type is used.  So you won't see
Any use of <code>DWORD</code> or <code>VOID</code>.  Instead, you'll see native C++ types 
such as <code>long</code>, <code>int</code>, and <code>void</code>.  The
only aliasing of primitive types are the following found in <code>classics\common.h</code>:

<pre>
typedef unsigned long ulong;
typedef unsigned short ushort;
typedef unsigned char byte;
</pre>

<P>Pointer types are not typedefed to their own names.  That is, a pointer to a <code>FOO</code> is not <code>PFOO</code>, but
is properly spelled as <code>FOO*</code>.</P>

<P>Most of the time, however, references are used instead of pointers.  Just about everyplace that the
traditional WINDOWS.H file uses a pointer for a parameter, RatWin uses a reference instead.</P>

<P>If you really want to use <code>WORD</code> and other common WINDOWS.H types, you can include
the file <code>"ratwin\winnames.h"</code>.  This declares these names in the <code>winnames</code> namespace.  You
can then dump these into the global namespace with a <I>using</I> directive.</P>

<pre>
#include "ratwin\winnames.h"
using namespace ratwin::winnames;

//now this works:
DWORD x= 5;
</pre>

<A NAME="9"><H4>Enumeration Constants and Flags</H4></A>

<P>The traditional WINDOWS.H file uses lots and lots of #define constants.  In C++, this is properly
done with constants and enumerated types.  In general, RatWin uses a named enumeration
to group a set of related flags.</P>

<P>When flags are mutually exclusive, or if there are 3 or fewer flags so it becomes feasable
to enumerate every legal combination, the API function is strongly typed to accept that
enumeration type.</P>

<P>In other cases, where the user is expected to combine flags using logical OR, the API signature is not
strongly typed because combining two enumeration constants with an | operator in C++ produces
an int for a result.  C++ does not avail itself toward easy type checking in this case.</P>

<P>What to do about this is still under deliberation.  It seems natural to use a
<A HREF="../class_summary.html#flagword">flagword</A> from Classics, which is feasable because,
as a template, the implementation is entirely in a header file and will not cause a dependancy on
another DLL.  This has not yet been done, though.  In the future, you can expect strong type
checking on all flags parameters as well.</P>

<A NAME="10"><H4>Structures and Classes</H4></A>

<P>The various structures from the Win32 API are provided under the same name.  Sometimes,
member functions are added.  But these types still qualify as <A HREF="#fn1" TARGET="footer">PODS</A>
and may use aggregate initializers.</P>

<P>Adding a constructor is commonly done, but this is done in a derived class.  For example,
struct <code>WNDCLASS</code> is a PODS , and can be used with 
<A HREF="#fn2" TARGET="footer">aggregate initializers</A>
or left uninitialized, as in traditional Windows programming.  But class <code>window_class : public WNDCLASS {</code>
&hellip; takes this structure and adds a proper constructor.  You can use <code>window_class</code> in new
code and take advantage of the constructor to fill in all the fields correctly with reasonable
values, or you can still use <code>WNDCLASS</code> to bypass the calling of a constructor.</P>

<P>The names of the data members of the structures varies.  Most use the same names as the traditional
WINDOWS.H declarations, but I've experimented with "reformed" simple names as well as ways to
provide both traditional and reformed names at the same time.</P>

<A NAME="7"><H4>HANDLE and other Hxxx Types</H4></A>

<P>For "Isa" relationships among the Hxxxx types, I use inheritance.  So, everything "is&nbsp;a" HANDLE.  This will actually 
use multiple inheritance when I get to that point, since the relationship is complex.  The inability to 
model this complex type system in C is probably why the existing "STRICT" mode punts at so many points.</P>

<P>A full hiarachy of HANDLE types and compiler-awareness of the "isa" relationships between
them will be fleshed out in an upcoming version.</P>

<H3>Functions</H3>

<P>In general, a function does the same thing as the function with the same name in the Win32 API.  After
all, this is just a C++ header file to get to the entry points in the various system DLLs, not a whole
library in itself.  So, the functions have the same names and take the same parameters in the same order.</P>

<P>Rather than macros to select a -A or -W form of a function, overloading is used.  You can call
TextOut, for example, passing it a <code>char*</code> or passing it a <code>wchar_t*</code>.  Either way, the
correct form is automatically used and there is no need for conditional compilation.</P>

<P>Note that not all functions are declared.  The "add it as you need it" growth of RatWin ensures that
everything in there is tested, and it stays small because functions nobody ever uses are not included.  If
you find that, for example, <code>FooBar(char*)</code> is present but <code>FooBar(wchar_t*)</code> is missing,
<A HREF="#5">add it</A>!</P>

<P>Some functions take parameters that can be a string <I>or</I> a number; or a menu handle <I>or</I> a child ID.
For functions that have one or two such parameters, it's practical to provide overloaded signatures that
provide strong type checking of all legal parameter types and require no casting on the part of the caller.
For functions that take more than two such flexible parameters, another way is needed.  The new way is to
use an internal type for the parameter that represents the set of legal choices (e.g. <code>char*</code> or <code>int</code>) and
has constructors to provide implicit conversions from those types.</P>

<A NAME="11"><H3>Namespace and Fragmentation Mania!</H3></A>

<H3>Organization</H3>

<A NAME="3"><H2>Compatability with WINDOWS.H</H2></A>

<H3>Binary Compatibility</H3>

<P>Code compiled using RatWin is fully compatible with code compiled using <code>WINDOWS.H</code>.  That is,
handles obtained using RatWin may be passed to functions declared in <code>WINDOWS.H</code>, or
vice versa; structures filled in by RatWin are identical to those used by <code>WINDOWS.H</code>, etc.</P>

<P>After all, RatWin is just a set of C++ header files providing access to the code
that already exists in the system DLLs.  It doesn't provide significant code itself.  The system
doesn't care what header the C++ compiler used to gain an understanding of the contents
of the system DLLs; however it was accomplished, the DLL entry point needs to be called
correctly.</P>

<P>You may have some OBJ files compiled with RatWin and link these with other OBJ files compiled
using <code>WINDOWS.H</code>, without conflict.</P>

<H3>General Source Compatibility</H3>

<P>Unfortunatly, this compatability does not extend to the source level.  Although RatWin tries to put
everything inside a namespace and keep the global scope unpolluted, the <A HREF="#4">"cloaking" technology</A>
used to implement the headers in a portable manner requires that signatures declaring the various system
functions indeed be present at global scope. </P>

<P>Because C++ doesn't allow overloading functions with "C" linkage, this naturally
conflicts with the contents of <code>WINDOWS.H</code>.  In short, both <code>WINDOWS.H</code> and RatWin headers
declare (for example) a function called <code>CreateWindow</code>.  This is a conflict.</P>

<P>If RatWin is re-implemented to use 
<A HREF="#fn3" TARGET="footer">forwarding COFF records</A> instead of cloaked global
declarations, this conflict will go away.  For now, you have a general problem in that
<code>WINDOWS.H</code> and RatWin cannot be #included in the same translation unit.</P>

<P>The solution is to separate RatWin-based code and<code> WINDOWS.H</code>-based code
into different translation units.  For code that is modular, cohesive, and uncoupled,
this is not a big problem.  For spegehetti code that calls anything from anywhere,
it can be a difficulty.</P>

<P>Note that this declaration-compatibility issue is not just for RatWin.  Microsoft's own
DDK headers are also incompatible with <code>WINDOWS.H</code> !  A reusable module that
itself used <code>WINDOWS.H</code> could not be reused for a device driver project.  However,
a resusable component written using the RatWin <code><I>=struct</I></code> files described below
could be reused for a DDK-based project or anywhere else.</P>

<P>Proper use of RatWin allows you to write reusable components
that's actually more compatible than <code>WINDOWS.H</code>.</P>

<A NAME="maxcompat"><H3>Maximizing Source Compatibility</H3></A>

<P>To prevent being part of the problem, header files can be designed
so they are not coupled to either <code>WINDOWS.H</code> or the problem parts of RatWin.</P>

<P>RatWin only has a source-compatability problem with global
function declarations of actual API functions.  Code in a header does
not need to refer to global functions, if functions that do such calling
are placed in .CPP files and not in the header.  What headers
need are type definitions, and these cause no problems with
compatibility.  RatWin puts all its types inside a namespace, so
it can have all the types it wants without polluting the global scope.</P>

<P>To this end, type definitions are separated out from API
function declarations into different headers.  These headers
have a <code><I>=struct</I></code> suffix on their names.</P>.

<P>Suppose, if you were writing a header file <code>comm.h</code> that referred to
sockets, and comm.h included <code>"ratwin\winsock2.h"</code>, then <code>comm.h</code> would be
coupled with RatWin and incompatible with <code>WINDOWS.H</code>.  A user could
not include <code>comm.h</code> and include <code>WINDOWS.H</code> in the same <code>.CPP</code> file.</P>

<P>Likewise, if <code>comm.h</code> included <code>WINSOCK.H</code> to get what it
needed, it would be coupled with <code>WINDOWS.H</code> and incompatible
with RatWin.  A user could not include <code>comm.h</code> and RatWin headers in
the same <code>.CPP</code> file</P>

<P>The solution is to write comm.h so it gets what it needs
by including<code> "ratwin\socket2=struct.h"</code>.  This header is very
well behaved and does not affect the global scope, or
anything other than the <code>::ratwin</code> namespace.</P>

<P>Now, comm.h is compatible with <I>anything</I>.  A user
may include <code>comm.h</code> and also include <code>WINDOWS.H</code>, or may
also include RatWin headers, or the Windows DDK headers, or use any other include file set
that provides access to the Win32 API.</P>
